# M/S Reading Room (v1-Sample)

## Development

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`, lint the code with `npm run lint`, and auto-format the code with `npm run format`.
