I understand that your office has advised Congressman Matsui that my grandmother will not be granted permanent residency in the United States but that her departure will not be enforced by your office. I have in my previous application explained the condition of her health. As of now, her health has not improved at all since then. She requires constant care and to be with her family here. Since there is nobody in India to take care of her, I request once again to give an extension of her voluntary departure date. Her doctor's certificate is attached herewith. Hoping for an early reply, Yours sincerely, Mrussemitharwale"
