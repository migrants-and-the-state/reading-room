Charles C. Sava District Director 26 Federal Plaza New York, New York 10278 RE : DE LOUIS, Ferdinand Edgar A28 438 659 Dear Mr. Sava: We herein request an extension of voluntary departure for Reverend Ferdinand Edgar De Louis, a Roman Catholic priest practicing his ministry under the authority of the Diocese of Brooklyn. Father De Louis applied for adjustment as a special Minister. By a misunderstanding, his application was denied on the grounds that he hadn't carried on his vocation as a priest since 1983. This is not true. Nevertheless, he must depart by November 26, 1987. These are the reasons for the extension: (1) We require time to send his papers to a Consulate. There is no question that he qualifies as a Special Immigrant. According to CFR 8 $242.5: [ Voluntary departure may be granted to any alien who is statutorily eligible: (vi) who is admissible to the United States as an immigrant and: (B) is otherwise exempt from the numerical limitation on immigrant visa issuance Classes (vi) (A) (B), and (C) may be granted voluntary departure until the American consul is ready to issue an immigrant visa, and, in the discretion of the District Director, may be in in- crements of 30 days, ] ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE: 75 GREENE AVENUE, P.O. BOX \"C\"-BROOKLYN, N.Y. 11202"
