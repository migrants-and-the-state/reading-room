U.S. Immigration and Customs HOMELAND SECURITY Enforcement Interoffice Memorandum To: File A28 740 267 From: K. DeBisschop, SFR/DRO Urburhy Date: February 5, 2007 Re: DACS Case Closure Subject Marcelino SOLIS ROMERO failed to appear at his EOIR hearing on February 5, 1991. His case was adminstratively closed by an immigration judge at that time. There has been no Agency contact with the subject since then. On this date standard computer checks were run in a negative attempt to locate the subject. As the subject would be more than one-hundred years old at this time it is recommended that the DACS case be closed as \"dead\" as of the date of his one-hundred birthday."
