Dear Sirs: Reference: Re-entry permits for my parents Father: NARAINDAS SITLANI, alien number A-34-733-884 Mother: GOPI SITLANI, alien number A-34-733-885 My parents applied for re-entry permits in November, 1977 and had requested that the documents be mailed to our above N.Y. address. We were advised that they should be mailed within a couple of months. However, we have not yet received them; and when I phoned your office yesterday, the lady told me to write a letter so as to be informed as to when the re-entry permits will be available. For your information, I have copied the receipts on the reverse of this letter. Thank you for your help. Yours very truly: RANJIT SITLANI"
