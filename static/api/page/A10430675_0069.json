I am afraid that I made a mistake on one of them. From February to May of 1947 I lived at 27 - 27th Ave. S. E., , Minneapolis, not 27 Oak Street S. E. 27 - 27th Ave. S. E. is at the terminal of the Oak-Harriet Street car line which accounts for the error. I am sorry to have made the mistake and I hope this will set the record straight. Sincerely yours, Trianting Maoling Liu Lin ML: jlw SECURITY IMM. RECEIVED ST. NAT PARSIRE 16 1951 EDITION g-6-5 1851 FOUNDED IN THE FAITH THAT MEN ARE ENNOBLED BY UNDERSTANDING .
