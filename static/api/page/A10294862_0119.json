He requests that his deporta- tion to the China mainland be withheld as he fears physical persecution at the hands of the Communist authorities because of his opposing polit- ical beliefs. On October 31, 1956, pending receipt of official information which could assist in resolving the issues presented in this case, the applicant and other Chinose nationals in similar circumstances were granted a stay of deportation until July 1, 1957, It was believed that by that time the cooperating agencies of the United States government would have succeeded in obtaining the desired information; and this case, along with the others, could then receive further consideration. Such information not having been obtained as of this date, stay of deportation until January R, 1953, will be authorized. It should be made clear, however, that the conclusion reached in this case is not applicable, and no stay of deportation will be granted, to an individual Chinese national concerning whom there is positive affirmative proof that he would be welcomed by the authorities in Communist China upon his return there because of his express or implied sympathy for or cooperation with the present regime. Likewise, it should be clear that any stay of deportation granted by this order will not preclude the Service from attempting to deport or from deporting an alien to a place other than the mainland of China."
