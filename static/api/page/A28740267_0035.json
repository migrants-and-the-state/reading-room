Department of Justice Imigration adn Naturalization SErvice 630 Samsome St San Francisco, Ca. 94111 File: A28 740 267 (E-24) Gentlemen: I would like to testify on behalf of my father MARCELINO SOLIS ROMERO, a Nicarguan citizen, 83 years of age, who may face very stiff penalties if he returns to Nicaragua. I was a member of the Sandinista Police force, (forced) and I can not live there anymore due to the condition of the military procedures. In July of 1986, I decided to leave the country (Nicaragua) but I did it without notifying the military commander that I belongs to. In other words I am a deserter of the Sandinsita forces and if either me or my father return to Nicaragua we will be in very dangerous problem/situation. To be honest with you, I do not care to much for my person, but my father is a very old man, with no relatives in Nicaragua, nobody to take care of him and facing the posiblities of being questioned or tortured by the Sandinistas in order to find out about my whereabouts. At this point, I beg and ask for mercy on behalf of my father. Please be considerate and understand the potenti√°l problems that may exist for my father He can not go back to Nicaragua. The Sandista Government will make his mi rable and many things could happendto him, without life taking into consideration his age, or the fact that we live in the U.S. One more time, I want to ask youyto consider my father request for Political Asylum, taking into consideration the fact that while he has lived in the U.S. he never has received one penny from a governmental agency or authority. He has lived with my sister, who is a legal resident since 1966 and is the process to become an American citizen, buying her residence since 1975, Under penalty of perjury, I declare that the above statement is nothing but the trueve 204/2 Florencio Solis 208 Santos St San Francisco, Ca. 94134"
