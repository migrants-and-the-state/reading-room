Please note that we would like to re-activate the files ( A 21 557 566 and A 21 557 567 ) to obtain the Permanent Residentship status for my parents who are now in the United States on the Visitor Visa. Last year they had to leave the United States due to un avoidable circumstances of the family health. I shall greatly appreciate your sending me the application form ( Form I-485 ) as early as possible so that we may continue with their immigration process. Thank you very much. Sincerely yours, Parimal M. Patel Parimal M. Patel"
