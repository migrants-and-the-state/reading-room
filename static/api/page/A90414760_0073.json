The Department of State advised that, based on the information submitted, they are unable to conclude that you should be exempted from regular Immigration procedures on the ground of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group upon return to Nicaragua. The Department of State's views are material to the decision that will be rendered in the request for asylum. Therefore, you are hereby granted fifteen days from the date of this notice for the inspection, explanation, and rebuttal of the statement furnished by the Department of State. Enclosed is a copy of the findings of the Department of State that led to their recommendation. If additional information is not received within the allotted period, the decision in this matter will be based on the information contained in our records. Sincerely, Perry A. Rivkind District Director"
