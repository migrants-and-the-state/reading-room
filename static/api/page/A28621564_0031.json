Roman 13325 SW 47 Street Miami, FL 33175 Dear Mr. Roman: I have concluded, upon consultation with the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, Department of State, that you have established a well-founded fear of persecution upon return to your homeland. Therefore, in accordance with Section 208 (a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, your Request for Asylum in the United States is granted as of the date of this letter. If your spouse and/or children were included on your application, this authority shall also apply to them. Your asylum status may be terminated if it is subsequently determined you are no longer a refugee within the meaning of Section 101 (a) (42) (A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, or that you pose a danger to the community or to the security of the United States. pu You are authorized to remain in the United tates until one year from the date of this letter, at which time you must arrange to be interviewed to determine your continuing eligibility for asylum. Employment is authorized during this period. If you plan to depart the United States, it will be necessary for you to obtain prior permission to return. You may apply for permanent residence under section 209 (b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act upon being physically present in the United States for at least one year after asylum was granted. If you have a spouse or children living outside the United States, you may submit a written request on form I-730 that they be admitted to the United States to join you. You must comply fully with the instructions on form I-730 when making such a request. Please keep this office informed of any change in your address. Sincerely, Cerry a Rindin' on Perry A. Rivkind District Director"
