If your mother wishes to file such an applica- tion, the enclosed Form I-485 and relating forms should be executed in accordance with the instruc- tions and submitted to this office with the required fee and documents. Very truly yours, James P. Korn Acting Assistant District Director Travel Control Encs. JPK:lfa"
