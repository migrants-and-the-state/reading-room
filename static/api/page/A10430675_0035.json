Such authorization to remain in the United States has been revoked. Therefore, it will be necessary that you de- part from the United States by not later than September 6, 1955. I regret to say that failure to do so will result in institution of deportation proceedings. When you leave the United States, please surrender this letter and your temporary entry permit at the port of departure to either a United States immigration officer or to a transporta- tion company representative in order that your exit may be veri- fied and the file in your case closed. After your travel reservations have been secured, please notify this office by letter as to the date, port, and manner of your contemplated departure, as well as your ultimate destination abroad. I hope you had an enjoyable stay in the United States. May you have a pleasant return trip. Very truly yours, J. Do PERFETTO GJM Acting Officer in Charge REGISTERED MAIL RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED"
