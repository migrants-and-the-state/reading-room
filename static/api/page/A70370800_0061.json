He is accompanied by 44 dependents of whom 22 are included in this application. Mr Hagi Mohamad's son has apparently already visited JVA and has also filed an AOR on behalf of his father and many siblings and step siblings. As Mr Hagi Mohammad is very old and suffering from various ailments, as are two of his sons (medical reports attached) we would be grateful if he could be scheduled for an interview in Nairobi rather than in the camps. Thank you for your continued cooperation. Sincerely, Nathan J. Rabe Regional Resettlement Officer Ms Pamela Hutchings JVA Nairobi"
