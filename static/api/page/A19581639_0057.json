Although she currently resides in the United States with family members, the circumstances are such that she is ineligible to obtain permanent residence here. She is in poor health, suffering from spondylitis, osteoporosis, glaucoma and aphakia and requires continuous care. The cost of her medical care is being borne by public funds. She has no close relatives in India and no means of support apart from her family in the United States. Prior to making a determination in this case we are requesting that you advise this office if there are facilities in India which will provide care for this individual. Thank you for your assistance in this matter. Sincerely David N. Ilchert District Director"
