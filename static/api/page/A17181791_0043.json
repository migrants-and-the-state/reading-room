S. TRAINING AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE SERVICE DATE: May 26, 1970 Mr. Philip S. Fogg 720 S. San Rafael Avenue Pasadena CA 91105 Re: Application for Alien Employment Certification for Betty Pei-ing MAO The Department of Labor has made a determination in the above request. Final action has been taken as follows: 1. Form ES-575 has been certified and is enclosed with the supporting documents. All en- closures should be submitted to the Immigration and Naturalization Service District Office either with your petition (Form I-140) or for consideration of alien's application for adjustment of status. 2. Form ES-575 has been certified and forwarded to the Consulate at which the alien has indicated he will file a visa application. The Consular Officer will inform the alien of the additional documents to be submitted and steps to be taken in order to apply for an immigrant visa. 3. On the basis of information available to us, we cannot issue the certification required by Section 212 (a) (14) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. Reason: Available job market information will not warrant a certification of unavail- ability of workers in the U.S. Remarks: Sincerely yours, Joseph d. House CC: Mr. Thomas C. Waterhouse, Atty Delbridge, Linton & Waterhouse, Offices Certifying Officer 99 S. Lake Ave. Suite 570 cc: State ES-Agency Pasadena CA 91101 BES FL 71.48 519 (Rev. 3.67)"
