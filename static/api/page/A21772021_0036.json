Since our parents are old and there is no one else to take care of them in India, we approach you with the request that on compassionate grounds they be allowed to stay with us on permanent basis. This will go a long way to enable us to look after them in their old age. The necessary forms for the purpose are being submitted here with. Thanking You, Very Sincerely Yours bahilidingh. 1.
