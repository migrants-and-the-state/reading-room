Army Research Office - Far East STATES OF ATTENTION OF Unit 45002, APO, AP 963370-5002 Fax: (03)3423-1832, Phone: (03)3423-1374; E-mail: arofe01@zama-emh1.army.mi Alternate Fax: (03) 3403-9670 30 June 1998 Immigration and Naturalization Service P. O. Box 7390 Laguna Niguel, CA 92607 Dear Sir/Madame: I am writing on behalf of my mother, Mrs. Chi Su Wu, for her application to be a citizen of the United States of America. My mother became a U.S. permanent resident in 1974 and has lived with my younger sister and brother-in-law, Dr. Joyce Yeh and Dr. Harry Yeh since my father passed away in 1991. Her PR status was discontinued because she had to be with her ailing husband in Taiwan till his death. My mother has raised four children, all are good U.S. citizens, not to mention her grand children. My mother is now 84 years old, she has trouble to remember and to retain information in a new language. Such deficiency is certified by a medical doctor as shown in the Form N-648 attached. Finally, I am her first born son and have dedicated nearly 30 years of my life working for the Government of the United Stated (Department of the Army). I am hereby to plead for your consideration to have her citizen examination conducted in Chinese. This consideration of passion and kindness is within your legal authority, and, is certainly a deed of humanity for a senior citizen who has contributed much to the well being of this country by bringing up her four children to be productive citizens of this great nation. For a moment, please, just think that she is your own mother too. Thank you. Respectfully yours, Julian J. Wu, DIRECTOR GS-15 Mathematician U.S. Army Research Office - Far East Printed on Recycled Paper"
