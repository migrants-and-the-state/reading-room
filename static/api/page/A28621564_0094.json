At that moment this was the only alternative I had to save my life, but I am positive that if it would not have been for my technical expertise and the inmediate need they had of my services, they would have put me in prison as it happened to many others of my co-workers. #38 Continued the National Guard they were harsh and treated me despectively. But once it was clear to them that I could be of service because of my experience, they offered me the option to work with them and to keep my freedom. Nevertheless, I knew that they had me under surveillance all the time, that they were informed of my actions and of whom I spoke to. I had to work long hours and there were times I was asked to go from one location to another even when no transportation was available. I am sure that they had the inten- tion of mistreating me even if it was only psychologically, as I was an old person who would be easier to put pressure on."
