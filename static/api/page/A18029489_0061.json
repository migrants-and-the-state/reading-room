Dear Sir, This has reference to my visa petition filed by post on July 27,1968 on 1 Form I- 140 with 2 Form ES- 575A 3 Passport No I- 498246 issued by India. 4 Professional certificate. 5 Copy of the above certificate. 6 $ 10.00 check. for classification under third preference and adjustment of status as lawful permanent resident. In the above connection I further inform you that my sons are living in U.S.A. since 1961. They are already lawful permanent residents of U.S.A. My eldest son married an American girl in Dec 1965 and as he completes three years in Dec 1968 he becomes eligible for American citizenship in Dec 1968. He thus gets his citizenship sometimes between Dec 1968 and Jan 1969 and immediately after getting it he petitions for me ( father) as immediate relative under Ist preference non quota immigrant. I request that the above fact may please be considered when taking a final decision on my already-filed visa petition under third preference. very truly yours, ( Vidya Vadya Sagar Pahwa ) RECEIVED U.S. immersion OCT14 1968 SEXIMI & Boston,"
