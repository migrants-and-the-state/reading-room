  "full_text": "Attachment IMPORTANT - This document must be read and signed by persons wishing to submit an affidavit of support on behalf of an alien apply ng for an immigrant visa. A signed copy of this document must be attached to each copy of any affidavit of support submitted on behalf of an applicant. The Social Security Act, as amended, establishes certain require- ments for determining the eligibility of aliens for Suppl√©mental Security Income (SSI) benefits. These amendments require that the income and resources of any person who as the sponsor of an alien's entry into the United States, executed Gt. affidavit of support or similar agreement on behalf of the alien, and the income and resources of the sponsor's spouse, shall be deemed to be the income and resources of the alien under formulas for determining eligibility for SSI benefits during the three years following the alien's entry into the United States. The eligibility of aliens for SSI will be contingent upon their obtaining the cooperation of their sponsors in providing the neces- sary information and evidence to enable the Social Security Admin- istration to carry out this provision. An alien applying for SSI must make available to Social Security Administration any documen- tation concerning his income or resources or those of his sponsors which he provided in support of his application for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to obtain copies of any such documentation from other agencies. The Social Security Act also provides that an alien and his or her sponsors shall be jointly and severably liable to repay any SSI benefits which are incorrectly paid because of misinformation provided by sponsors or because of sponsors failure to provide information, and any incorrect payments which are not repaid will be withheld from any subsequent payments for which the alien or sponsors are otherwise eligible under the Social Security Act. These provisions do not apply to an alien who becomes blind or disabled after entry into the United States. They also will not apply to aliens admitted as refugees or granted political asylum by the Attorney General, I, Chander / Marang residing at 4225 S.
