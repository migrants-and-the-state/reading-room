Mrs Bolanos was an active member within General Somoza Government and was the founder of The Feminine Party for Mr. Somoza Bayle's politic campaign. She occupied a position in the Department of Agri- culture and also, she had a close relationship with Somoza's family until General Somoza was defeated. For all of the above reasons Mrs. Bolanos can not go back to Nicaragua since this may endanger her freedom in that country. Sincerely Colonel Enrique Garcia G. Ex-Director of the Meteorogical Center of Nicaragua Washington Ave. & 12 St. Miami Beach, Florida Pars Davier Notary Public, State of Florida My Commission Expires Feb. 17, 1985 Bonded Ihry Troy Fain - Insurance, Inc. -"
