Upon careful review of the information submitted and assuming the facts of this case as stated in the application are true, it is our view that the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Nicaragua within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. I trust that this advisory opinion will be helpful in reaching a decision in this case. Sincerely, Edward H. Wilkinson, Director Office of Asylum Affairs Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs"
