Ungar, of Counsel Teresa A. Bright San Francisco, CA 94133 Terry J. Helbush Michael K. Ungar Tel: (415) 421-0860 Kip Evan Steinberg Bill Ong Hing, of Counsel FAX: (415) 421-0772 February 25, 1993 David Still Assistant District Director Immigration & Naturalization Service 630 Sansome Street San Francisco, CA 94111 Re: Josefa Feliciano Ramirez-Garcia aka Josefa Feliciana Ramirez-Guadamuz A28 961 620 Dear Dave, I'm writing to you to see if you can straighten out for me the problem in this person's file and find a solution so that the Texas Card Facility will issue her an alien registration card. The problem in this case is as follows: Mrs. Ramirez an 85-year old refugee from Nicaragua was granted residence status on October 25, 1989 but to date, the Texas Card Facility has yet to issue her an alien registration card. Last year, I filed a Freedom of Information Request to find out why after Social Security told her that she would be terminated from Medi-Cal. Tony Jue was kind enough to do some digging for me and found that the reason she hadn't been issued an alien registration card was because someone else mistakenly had been issued a card using Mrs. Ramirez's number. I wrote to Camille Chappell to whom Tony had given the file, and she advised me to bring Mrs. Ramirez in to file Form I-90 which I did on May 21, 1992. Now, she has gotten another letter from the Texas Card Facility again refusing to issue her an alien registration card because \"The alien number you provided on the application is incorrect. In addition, Social Security is again threatening to cut off her benefits. As Mrs. Ramirez is quite elderly and not in good health, I do not wish to bring her to the Immigration Service for another go around. I am hoping that you can suggest some solution to this problem so that her alien registration card can be issued. Perhaps, she could be assigned a new number because it appears that the Texas Card Facility will not issue an alien registration card to her in the number which currently belongs to her."
