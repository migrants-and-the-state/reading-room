Photographs I understand I am exempt from the reading, writing, and English re- quirements for naturalization by virtue of the recent amendment to section 312 (8U.S.C. 1423) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. In view of the fact I do not read or write English, I would ask that all correspondence be sent to my daughter, Donna Jue, at 568 Otero Court, Camarillo, California 93010. Thank you.
