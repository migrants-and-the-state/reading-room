	"full_text": "UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY MINNEAPOLIS 14 DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING June 17, 1955 To Whom It May Concern: I have known Mr. Maoling Liu for approximately 25 years. When I first became acquainted with him he was a student in the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Minnesota. This was in 1927 to 1929. He then transferred to the Physics Department as a student for the period 1929-31. At the present time he is employed by the University of Minnesota, and I am the head of the Department of Electrical Engineering in which he is employed. At my recommendation he was employed as an Instructor of Electrical Engineering in June 1947 and he has been continuously employed in this department to the present time. He has now been recommended for an advance in rank to Assistant Professor, and beginning in September 1955 he will serve the University at this rank. His salary at the new rank will be $4635 for the regular nine month school term September 16 to the following June 16. Because of the long period of satisfactory service which he has given to the University he has achieved tenure, that is he is no longer in a pro- bationary status and will have a position with the University as long as he desires to the age of 68 years. I am able to state without reservation that Mr. Liu is a man of honor, completely reliable, and a gentleman in every respect. By his past behavior he has merited the trust and confidence of all of his associates. Henry E. Hartig Professor and Head HEH:hp State of Minnesota County of Hennepin Subscribed and sworn to before me a notary public this 17 day of June, 1955. Glody 10.h Roskey GLADYS V. M.
