  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 9/20/2023 TRANSLATION Letter was written on aerogramme postmarked Dec. 5,1959, Hong Kong. Sender: Tung Fong Cafe, 406 Shanghai St., Kowloon, H.K. Addressee: Mrs. Philip Chow, 445 W. School St., Compton Calif.,U.S.A. CONTENTS Dec. 5 (1959) Dear Ching: Just received the US$40.00 you sent. Concerning your family affairs, I am very understanding. Your father-in-law was seventy and had children and grandchildren. It is only natural when he passed away your mother-in-law cried and felt very sad. Just imagine mest Under the circumstances, I can't help crying either. Only that I kept/to myself and was afraid to write you all about how I felt. I am longing for the day I will see you again. Ah Chix told me that he has been working in the theatre for more than three years non. He doesn't feel he has gotten any place at all. He said he want to learn how to drive, but then it takes money to do so. It costs $5 per hour driving leason, and it takes 50 to 60 hours of lesson, and afterwards it takes about $700.00 to $800.00 \"tea money\" to get the driver's license. So it takes almost a year's time to reach his goal. It doesn't seem possible at this point. One can see auto accidents in the newspaper almost every day. Drivers were fined in small accident. In more serious cases, drivers were either sent to jeil or had their license taken away. It is extremely hard to make a living in Hong Kong nowadays, even to make a bare living. Furthermore, there are thousands of professional drivers. What do you think? Please let me know, the next time you write. Ah Fai has his own business here and he made a gross profit of about $1000.00, and netted about $620.00 after all expenses. Business is good, but it is a pitty that there isn't enough capital. Cheung Cheuk Sun invested $2,000.00. If there is suffi- cient money to go around, he will make purchase about $800.00 to $1000.00 a day during the month of December, because near the and of the year people start buying gifts, ducks, sausage and so forth. Ah Far will be 20 years old in a month or so. It will be very difficult far her to fird @ fine man, because there are thousands of girls here waiting to get married. I don't want her to go to another country, because I wish she could live near her sister. Anything can be discussed. Please try your best to find a fine B@B for her there. It wouldn't matter, even if the man is eight or ten years old then her, long as he is a fine man, Kang Toon has already returned to Canada with his wife and got a boy there. Kang Chook will come to Hong Kong in September and will get married Nov. 17. Aunt Chong is an elder lady. Every sen came back gave me $10.00 and invited me to dinner too. She is very nice. Best wishes to you all. Signed: Your mother P.S.: Ching: Please tell me who is taking care of FOIA (b)(6 everyday, after you and King gone to work. Certified true and correct translation of the letter in Chinese attached. 7/5/66"
