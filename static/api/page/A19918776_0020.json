La Salle Street Chicago, Illinois 60601 Dear Sir: Being foreign born, I am trying to establish as much proof of age as I can for social security purposes. I came to this country in 1921 and started school at the Brainard School, Washburne and Hoyne in September of 1921. I also attended the Shepard School in 1922 or 1923 under the name of Hannah or Harriet Haft. Would it be possible to obtain some kind of record as to the age given at the time I started school? Any information you can give me regarding the above would be most helpful in gathering the information I need for this purpose. If I can supply you with any additional information, please let me know. Sincerely, Mrs. Harriet Altman Mrs. Harriet Altman 1121 South Atlantic Blvd. Arlington Arms, Apt #15 Alhambra, California 91803 RECEIVED JAN 20 1959 DIVISION OF OFFICE SERVICES"
