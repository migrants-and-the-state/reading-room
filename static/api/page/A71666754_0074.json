United Nations High Commisioner For Refugees CHAIRMAN P.O. Box 1076 Martha Lee Doyle Addis Ab√°ba, Ethiopia VICE CHAIRMAN Roland E. Blanding, Jr. SECRETARY Stuart A. Cashin, Jr. Dear Sir/Madam: TREASURER James F. Harrington I am writing you this letter in regards to a Somali refugee family residing in Ethiopia. I had written a Carolyn Long Banks letter to you before regarding this matter but received Rev. Thomas Carroll, M.S. no response so I hope this gets through to someone. Rev. Stephen Churchwell Dennis M. Crean The family in queston (please see the enclosed AOR) knows Susan DeDeyn they are supposed to go to Kenya to be processed as Henry deGive refugees but the head of the family, Hassan Omar, is an Walter Denero old man in deteriorating health and the family is worried Larry Dingle that he could not make the trip to Kenya. The family Becky Fratesi approached the American Embassy who referred them to you. John M. Howley, Jr. I am unclear as to exactly what you, UNHCR, told the Jerry Lett family to do. Evidently they have to have a written re- Marta Miller quest from our agency or something along those lines. John Murphy Michael Murphy If at all possible could you please help facilitate the Sr. Carolyn Oberkirch, R.S.M. processing of this case with the U.S. Embassy. The family William M. Rich here in the U.S. are very concerned about their relatives Gonzalo Saldana in Ethiopia and are on me to do something about it. Kathyrn Buckley Smith Sr. Marie Sullivan, O.P. Please advise me how I should proceed in this matter. Lorne Twiner My telephone number is 404/885-7243 and my fax # is Christopher Valley 404/888-7816. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR Sincerely, Steven L. Brazen CATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICES, INC. -13th Kannah Bob Kamack Migration & Refugee Services USCC 680 West Peachtree St., NW, Atlanta, Georgia 30308, 404/881-6571, FAX 404/888-7816"
