Distric Director Immigration and Naturalization Service U.s.court house Buffalo N. Y 14202 chitz to DDS Dear Sir: 4/13/72 Ref: file No. A 19 360 870 This will acknowledge the receipt of your letter written to my mother saying\" you have failed to establish that you intend to depart from the United States within a definite time.\" at this conclusion. Possibly there is communication gap. this ? I don't really undrstand what made you to arrive for that I would like to state the followings: When the date of expirary on her present I-94 them was approaching, I contacted your Rochester office told them that we need extension. I was asked If I was a citizen? I said not yet, but I will be before the end of this year. Well in that case you can ask for extension now and then at later date she can go for a card to avoid future extension formalities. So, what should I do now? We will mail you the form fill it in and mail to Buffalo office, with that you can state that you want extension till you become a citizen. That is what I did. There is no doubt in my mind that she is not going to be with me for the rest of her life, but I do want a way out sothat when she chooses to visit us next, she does not have to go through the mounting paper work and especially in India, where the system is not to my satisfaction. At this stage I would like to back track this matter. Some time back when I learnt about her deterioting health, I got conserned. So I asked her to visit us. It was hard to con- vince her but upon persistant effforts she came over. I saw her after eight years and she was really down. Possibly this comes with the age. Anyhow after her arrival, with the help of my doctor friend, she followed and is following the strict diet and exercise prgram. It was hard to determin if her ill health was due to the after effect of her mahor surgey. Above all I am glad to note that she has improved considerably. I am sure, It should not take her long to lead the normal healthy life of her own. The only negative factor for her is the sever cold weather. But one has to trade off every thing for health. On the other hand when she is fit, she wants to be back home of her own, that is o.k with me, but I always tell her, my house is open for her any time."
