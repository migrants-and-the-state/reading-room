  "full_text": "1216 Arch Street, 4th Floor MM Nat bralities Philadelphia, PA 19107 Phone: 215-893-8400 Fax: 215-735-9718 Service Center E-mail: info@nscphila.org www.nscphila.org Ms. Sanchez is requesting due consideration for the history and government examination under 8 CFR § 312.2(c)(2). Again, Ms. Sanchez is 102 years old, and she has been a lawful permanent resident for twenty-six years. Due to her age, her memory is deficient. In addition, she was only able to attend school until the second grade in Nicaragua. As a result, she has difficulty reading. Although Ms. Sanchez has difficulty reading and remembering new information, her family helps her study for the citizenship exam daily. Ms. Sanchez is also requesting an accommodation based on the fact that she is hard of hearing. She asks that you please allow time to repeat questions and for her interpreter to speak loudly and slowly. Thank you in advance for your consideration of this matter. If you have any questions, please contact me at 215-609-1546 or arodriguez@nscphila.org. Respectfully submitted, Abel Rodríguez Esq. Staff Attorney United Serving immigrants and refugees in the Delaware Valley since 1921. Way United Way Donor #88 A United Way Agency"
