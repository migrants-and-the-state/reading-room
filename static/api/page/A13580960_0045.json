SOCIAL WORKER April 15, 1963 LOS ANGELES 33, CALIFORNIA ANGELUS 1-2047 Immigration and Naturalization Service 510 South Vermont Los Angeles 5, California Re: Genia LAUTURE Gentlemen: This is to inform you of the difficulties we have experienced in trying to assist Mrs. Genia Lauture to complete her application for an immigrant visa. As we informed you in our letter last month, we forwarded her application for an immigrant visa to the American Consulate at Tijuana on February 2, and when it was rejected at that consulate because of inability to assume jurisdiction due to their overcrowded condition, we forwarded her application to the American Embassy at Mexico City on February 28. It was not until late last week that we received an answer from the American Embassy informing us that they also were unable to handle the case due to crowded conditions. We then telephoned the American Consulate at Montreal, Canada, where Mrs. Lauture has relatives that can care for her and were informed that that consulate would be happy to handle her case and would be able to issue her an ap- pointment within four weeks. We then communicated with the Canadian immigration officer at San Francisco and asked him for permission for Mrs. Lauture to enter Canada for the purpose of applying for her immigrant visa at Montreal. The immigration officer informed us, however, that he would be glad to issue the necessary permission, but was forbidden to do so by Canadian regulation until Mrs. Lauture presented a definite appoint- ment from the American Consulate at Montreal. Therefore, in order to enable us to obtain the appointment from the American Consulate at Montreal and obtain the necessary entry permit into Canada, we need four weeks time. It would be very helpful to Mrs. Lauture and her family if you can extend the time of her voluntary departure for that amount of time. Thank you for your help. Very truly yours, Delfino Varelag Delfino Varela, Social Worker enc. ASSISTANCE & GUIDANCE WITH IMMIGRATION MARITAL. & PERSONAL PROBLEMS"
