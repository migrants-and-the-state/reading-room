Parks, Investigator, El Paso, Texas SUBJECT: VICENTE DE LA HOYA; A10 534 184. Inasmuch as investigation conducted in Los Angeles as shown by report of August 28, 1956 fails to show the subject had any guilty knowledge of fraud, investigation in this case is considered closed and it is recommended that the documents contained in this work folder be forwarded to Los Angeles for incorporation in the file which was apparently retained by that office. b Parker"
