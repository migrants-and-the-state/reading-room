	"full_text": "Screened by NARA, 6/1/2023 Artillery. The growth of EPS's artillery force has been equally dramatic. During the revolution, the San- dinistas' fire-support weapons consisted of nothing larger than mortars. When they defeated Somoza's National Guard, they inherited three 105-millimeter howitzers. During their first year in power, the Sandinistas began receiving ZIS-2s, Soviet-made 57-millimeter antitank guns. By 1981, they were obtaining D-30s, Soviet-made 122-millimeter howitzers far surpassing in range and firepower all other artillery in Central America. That same year, they began acquiring D-20s, Soviet-made 152-millimeter howitzers, which represented a further qualitative increase in their artillery capability. In 1982, Soviet-made BM-21s, capable of launching a barrage of 40 122-mil!imeter rockets, arrived, greatly in- creasing the Sandinis is' area bombardment capability. In 1983, the Sandinistas formally inaugurated a special artillery brigade, based in Managua. Currently, the EPS's inventory includes 24 D-30s, 24 D-20s, 24 BM-21 multiple rocket launchers, and scores of antitank guns, as well as hundreds of mortars. Somoza's artillery consisted of three 105-millimeter howitzers. As early as 1981, the Sandinistas began to acquire D-30 122-millimeter howitzers. The Soviet-made D-30 can fire a 48-pound shell nearly 10 miles. The Sandinistas have 24 D-30s. The D-20 152-millimeter howitzer is the largest artillery piece in Central America. It can fire a 96-pound shell nearly 11 miles. The Sandinistas have 24 D-20s. These D-20s are being towed by Soviet-made KRAZ-255 trucks. 11"
