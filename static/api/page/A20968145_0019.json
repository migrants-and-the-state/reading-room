WAGNER, M.D. RADIOLOGY Chuni Lal Narang Age: 66 IMM February 27, 1975 Dr. Bain CHEST PA film shows bilateral hilar calcifications and more than the usual prominence of the right hilum. In the right hilar shadow there is a semi-lunar density which is difficult to evaluate. It does not have the density of a solid mass but may represent adenopathy or possibly cavitation. Evaluation on the basis of this single film is not possible. Initially, I believe that both oblique views and a lateral projection should be obtained and then further x-rays may be considered. GBS:sh Three o other views were taken and were reported back Negative."
