Mr. Fonseca is an 83 year old native and citizen of Nicaragua who entered the United States without inspection in 1987. He is presently in deportation proceedings before the Honorable Immigration Judge Michael Horn. Mr. Fonseca has suffered two strokes in the past two years, which has resulted in partial paralysis. He is confined to a wheel chair. In addition, he suffers from diabetes. Because of these illnesses he continues under the care of a neurologist. He is not mentally competent at the present time, nor is he physically able to attend his hearing. Mr. Fonseca is totally destitute, so consequently, he has relied on the financial help his family gives him and on donations from the community, such as the donation of a wheel chair by the Miami Managua Lions Club. On behalf of Mr. Fonseca, undersigned Counsel respectfully requests that the Immigration and Naturalization Service take humane and reasonable action to terminate Mr. Fonseca's deportation proceedings. Respectfully submitted, Adalsinda Lomangino Enc. Medical evidence 780 NW 42nd Avenue, Suite 507 Miami, Florida 33126 (305) 448-1448"
