  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 6/29/2023 INSTRUCTIONS Form SW-409, as revised, is designed for use in all cases concerning applicants for admission who present altered or fraudulent documents or are impersonating another person or intend to or have misused the document presented. It is to be executed in its entirety in cases involving impersonation, altered, or fraudulent documents and distributed as needed. It is to be prepared in every case when a Form I-186 is lifted from an applicant for admission at a port of entry. In such cases only items 1 through lla need be completed. When the port that lifts Form I-186 is the office of issuance, SW-409 will be prepared in a single copy addressed to the Officer in Charge. After the action is taken (voidance or returned to alien); SW-409 will be filed for record purposes. Such forms will be purged and destroyed after one year. When the port that lifts Form I-186 is other than the office of issuance, SW-409 will be prepared in duplicate addressed to the Officer in Charge of the office of issuance. The duplicate will be filed at the office that lifted Form I-186. After the necessary action is taken at the office of issuance, the original will be filed at that office for record purposes. In both instances the forms shall be purged and destroyed after one year."
