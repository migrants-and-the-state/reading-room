Bakarich Immigration and Naturalization Service 333 U.S. Courthouse Portland, Oregon 97205 Dear Mr. Bakarich: I am writing this letter in support of my mother-in- law, Mrs. Nguyen Thi Nhat, and I am inclosing it with her application for an extension of stay here in the United States. My wife has beenin poor health since giving birth to our son, and her mother has been a great help in taking care of my wife, the baby and the house. Mrs. Nhat is an old woman with no other family or relatives to turn to in her old age. We have been very pleased to have her stay with us. We hope that you will grant her request for an extension of stay here in the U.S., and we assure you that there is no chance of her becoming a ward of the state what- soever. I hope that you will approve her application to extend her stay with us. Thank you very much. Sincerely yours, James M.M.Goever James M. McGeever Enc. - 1 form I-94 1 check for $10 (application fee) SHITTIN"
