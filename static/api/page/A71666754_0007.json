Omar APPLICATION/PETITION: I-131 DISCUSSION: Reference is made to your Motion to Reopen filed on March 23, 1999. You seek to reopen the decision rendered by this Service on November 30, 1998, denying the I-131 filed by you on June 12, 1998. The motion was received by this Service on March 23, 1999. Title 8, Code of Federal Regulations, part 103.5 states in pertinent part: Any motion to reopen a proceeding before the Service filed by an applicant or petitioner, must be filed within 30 days of the decision that the motion seeks to reopen, except that failure to file before this period expires, may be excused in the discretion of the Service where it is demonstrated that the delay was reasonable and was beyond the control of the applicant or petitioner. Your motion was received untimely and you have given no excusable reason for the delay. Therefore, your motion is rejected. This rejection does not preclude the filing of a new petition or application with a new fee; however, the priority or processing date of the denied application or petition will not be applied to the new filing. Sincerely, Natahe Vidder Natalie Vedder Director in KLJ"
