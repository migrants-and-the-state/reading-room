  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 7/13/2023 January 23, 1980 Attachment to Form I-541 Item #1 f The records of this Service indicate that you were admitted to the United States as a visitor for pleasure on December 2, 1978 and were authorized to remain until April 15, 1979. On March 28, 1979 you were granted an extension of authorized stay until October 2, 1979 to enable you to visit other parts of the U. S. On October 2, 1979 you were granted a further extension of autho- rized stay until February 2, 1980 because you stated that you needed time to apply for and obtain Canadian Immigrant Status. In the instant application you are requesting another extension of authorized stay until August 2, 1980. You claim that you are medically unfit to travel. Aletter from your doctor attest to this. You have failed to establish that, with treatment, you will be able to depart the United States within a definite period of time. The letter from your doctor would indicate that your condition is such that you will require the care of your family for an indefinite period of time. You indicate on the application that a relative visa petition was filed on your behalf and you applied for permanent residence in Baltimore, Maryland. For these reasons, it has been determined that you have failed to establish that you are, in fact, a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure and that you intend to depart from the United States within a defi- nite period of time. You are therfore ineligible for an extension of stay and your application is denied. You have been granted until April 23, 1980 in which to voluntarily depart. Near the end of this period of time, if you are still unfit to travel, you may request an extension of this departure date."
