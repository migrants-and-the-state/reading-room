Do you have your passport with you today, Mr. Lee? A. . Qo Now Mr. Lee on the passport, that you have just presented to me as your own, I note that on Page No. 13, there is a visitor's nonimmigrant visa issued to you by the American Consulate at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on March 27, 1968. Do you recognize this visa as being the one presented by you in order to enter the United States? A. I do realize that. Q. Now sir, at the time you obtained this visitor's visa from the American Consulate, what reasons did you give to him for wanting or desiring to enter the United States? A. My desire was that because FOIA (b)(6) We got the advice from Consulate in Brazil that we have approved applications in our file and also our lawyer, Mr. Bonapart told us too when we were in Brazil. Before we came up here. we have every month FOIA (b)(6) want to 8. Now sir, you state you didn't lose the time. You mean that you applied for the visitor's visa in order to hurry your entry into the United States? As your attorney has objected to that question, I will rephrase that question. You state that you wanted to come to the United States in order not to lose time, will you explain that please? A. Well, I can't explain that because the first time, we got advice as our attorney and also. We advised by the Consulate that the affidavit was issued by my wife and my friend, I should say, was not sufficient which I did not understand that from the Consulate, and we repeated asking for the papers which I told the first meeting also, and actually the time the friend was not in Los Angeles at the time and I think my attorney understood that who he was and that's why the reason ve we have to come up anyway as a tourist. Q. Now you stated that you were refused an application. Would you explain to me what application was refused and by whom? A. As I understood that it was not actually refused by my application, it was one kind of items which was the affidavit form which I would be pleased if you can refer to the Consulate in Brazil and as my attorney, he should have my file here and he should understand why I asked Mr. Bonapart to told the first inspector that is the one part of the reason and we couldn't wait. -3-"
