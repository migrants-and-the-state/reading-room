  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 7/31/2023 by Air-mail to the Boston office. ? On May 10, 76 my father again inquired in person at the Boston office and was informed that the files have not yet arrived at the Boston office. I fail to understand D why the Immigration office misinforms the public repeatedly and 2) why it takes more than 4 months for a simple job like transferring the files to another office. I was also told by Congressman Krebb's office ( 17th Congressional district, Calif.) that since I contacted your office is the first instance, I should contact you now besides the matter do not in his jurisdiction any way as the papers are filed is the Boston office. I do not know what to do from here and who to turn to -hence this letter and request for help from you in expediting this never-ending process. Thank you in anticipation of your help and prompt attention, Sincerely, Kamille Lathi mane. KAMILLE LATHI MANE 386 Conley Parterville, Calif. 93257 Enclosure Xerox copy of Notice of Approval for your convenience."
