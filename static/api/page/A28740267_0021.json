  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 7/28/2023 JAN 0 9 1989 Marcelino Solis-Romero 151 Sears Street San Francisco, CA 94112 A28 740 267 (E-24) Dear Mr. Solis-Romero: On September 21, 1987, you submitted a request for asylum in the United States based upon a claim that you would face persecution were you to return to Nicaragua. As a part of the processing of your application for political asylum in the United States, this Service has requested an advisory opinion from the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs of the U.S. Department of State. The Bureau has concluded that you have failed to establish that you have a well-founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the United Nations Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. The evidence you submitted in response to the Notice of Intent to Deny was considered. However, the record contains no objective evidence of significantly probative value to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution in Nicaragua. It is concluded that you do not qualify as a \"refugee\" within the meaning of Section 101 (a) (42) (A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, in that you have failed to establish either past persecution or a well- founded fear of future persecution in Nicaragua on account of your race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. There is no appeal from this decision. You may, however, renew your request for asylum or apply for withholding of deportation under Section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, in proceedings before an Immigration Judge. Please make reference to the A-file number listed at the top of this letter in all future contacts or correspondence with this Service. Sincerely, Philip LWater David N. Ilchert District Director DIEXM: any 12-27-88 kc"
