All positive results should be confirmed with a Western Blot test. A negative result does not fully exclude the possibility of HIV virus exposure or infection. Positive EIA and Western Blot results may indicate past HIV virus infection. Current activity of infection may not be measured in these tests. Positive EIA tests without confirmation by Western Blot may be falsely positive. The laboratory is required by law to perform a confirmatory test on repeatedly positive EIA results.
