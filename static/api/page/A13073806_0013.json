  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 6/29/2023 OMB # 1115-0194 U.S. Department of Justice Attestation by Immigration and Naturalization Service Designated Fingerprinting Service Certified to Take Fingerprints Part 1. Instructions To ensure the INS of the integrity of the fingerprint cards submitted by applicants for benefits, all DFS fingerprinters must fill out an attestation on Form 1-850A each time they take fingerprints for an immigration benefit applicant. The DFS's fingerprinters are required to execute the attestations in duplicate, giving the original copy to the person being fingerprinted and keeping the second copy, which may be a reproduced copy of the original attestation, on file for at least 3 months for Service inspection. Attestations must be submitted on Form 1-850A, Attestation by Designated Fingerprinting Service Certified to Take Fingerprints. Reproduced copies of Form I-850A are acceptable. Reporting Burden. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it dispays a currently valid OMB number. We try to create forms and instructions that are accurate, can be easily understood, and which impose the least possible burden on you to provide us with information. Often this is difficult because some immigration laws are very complex. Accordingly, the reporting burden for this collection of information is computed as follows: 1)Learning about the law and form 3 minutes 2) completing form 2 minutes and 3) Assembling and filing the application 5 minutes; for a total estimated average of 10 minutes per response. If you have comments regarding the accuracy of this estimate, or suggestions for making this form simpler, you can WRITE to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street, N.W.; Room 5307. Washington, D.C. 20536. (Do not mail your completed application to this address.) Part 2.
