	"full_text": "Screened by NARA, 9/18/2023 MAR Gong Doo Question 25 continued confiscated all my properties and holdings; assessed a fine of $5-million (Chinese) dollars. I was forced to sell my personal properties as well as my wife's and my children's to pay the assessed fine. Including all cash on hand and the money realized from the personal properties I could only pay off $2-million (Chinese) dollars. Because of my inability to pay off the fine in full, I was then sent to a labor camp in the mountains to gather fire-woods for one year. Then I was sent to the farm-labor camp and did farming work for one year. In 1953 I was allowed to travel beyond the original sentence of not over 5-li (5 miles) from my home village. By this relaxation of the travel limit I escaped and went into Macau. From Macau I went to Hong Kong in 1954."
