  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 8/18/2023 U.S. Department of Justice IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE FACT SHEET 3/19/97 FINAL INS RULE: EXCEPTIONS FROM ENGLISH AND CIVICS TESTING REQUIREMENTS FOR NATURALIZATION APPLICANTS WITH DISABILITIES On March 19, 1997, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) will publish a final rule in the Federal Register that implements Congressionally-mandated exceptions from the English and civics (U.S. history and government) requirements for naturalization for persons with disabilities that prevent them from meeting such requirements. This final rule makes changes to the proposed rule published in August 1996. The INS invites public comments for 60 days on certain new proposals contained in this final rule concerning quality control, the appeals process and training for adjudicators. BACKGROUND On October 25, 1994, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act of 1994. Section 108 (a) (4) of this Act amended Section 312 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to provide exceptions to the English proficiency and history and government knowledge requirements for naturalization for persons with \"physical or developmental disabilities\" or \"mental impairments. While the proposed rule was under development, INS provided policy guidance to its field offices with preliminary instructions for adjudication of naturalization applications based on the exceptions provided under the 1994 Technical Corrections Act. The Service also provided preliminary definitions of the terms concerning disability and mental impairment in the Act. The INS has consulted extensively with the Department of Health Services (HHS), the Social Security Administration (SSA), and other government health agencies for guidance in developing the regulatory language contained in this final rule. The INS published a proposed rule to implement this legislation change on August 28, 1996. INS has carefully considered 228 comments on the proposed rule which were submitted by a wide range of immigrant assistance groups, health professionals, organizations that assist persons with disability and individuals. The final rule addresses these comments and makes substantial modifications. 1"
