	"full_text": "IEWPOINT HEALTHCARE E D I C A L G R o U P January 6, 1999 RE: ESPINOZA, Candelaria To Whom This May Concern: Mrs. Espinoza is a 84-year-old female with history of hypertension for the past two years. She also has a history of cerebrovascular disease and possible previous myocardial infarction. She has been seeing Dr. George Chow, Neurologist, for a number of months for headache and forgetfulness. She also had surgery of the right eye for cataracts. She has significant reduced vision of her right and left eyes at the present time. It is my professional medical opinion that all the above mentioned medical problems will prevent her from taking the U.S. History and Civics examination for citizenship. Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please feel free to contact me at my office. Thanking you in advance, Olamy Alberto X. Campain, M.D. AXC:rh ALBERTO X.
