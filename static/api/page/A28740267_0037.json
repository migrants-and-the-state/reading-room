MARCELINO SOLIS ROMERO, applied for political asylum and his application has been tentatively denied under the fact that he failed to established a well founded fear of persecution, I would like to ask for some consideration to his request, because he may really facesa lot of problems if he return to Nicaragua. Please note that, most of his closed relatives lived here in the U.S. Many of us, (his grandchildren) were members of the Sandinista Military Police, and in my case I was a commander of reserve battalion for a period of 2 years and joined the Armed forces (Sandinista) since 1981, action that I was forced to take because of the potential retaliation if I failed to do so. At this point, all I can say about the possibilities of my grandfather jeopardy of suffer persecution by the Sandinista Government is that all of his young relatives, were members of the Sandinista Government and all of us are deserters of the Communist Armycthat the Sandinistas are. I am sure he will be questioned and put thru a lot of presure which may jeopardize his health. He is a very old man, 83 years of age, unable to go thru some torture procedures. Please consider his request and allow him to spend his last days in the U.S.He will hever become a public charge for the U. S. government. During his stay in the U.S. he has lived with mysaunt, his daughter and never has received a penny from the Government.
