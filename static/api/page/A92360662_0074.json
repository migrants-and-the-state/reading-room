MA n MATUS HUNTER Maria Matus-Hunter 1109 Oneonta Dr. Los Angeles, CA 90065 August 8, 1988 U.S. Department of Justice RE: MATUS-HUNTER, Maria Immigration and Naturalization Service A-92-360-662 P.O. Box 30040 Laguna Niguel, CA 92677 Attn: Mr. Joseph L. Thomas Director Processing Facility Dear Sirs: In response to your letter dated July 15, 1988, which requests additional documentation with regards to my legalization appli- cation; such as banking or credit records, utility bills, rent receipts, etc. Please allow the following clarification. When I entered the United States, along with my duaghter on August 4, 1979, I was 65 years old. I did not work and have never worked since. I have always tended to our home and cared for my FOIA (b)(6) years old at the time, while my daughter worked to support the three of us. This is the reason for which I submitted copies of my daughter's Income Tax Returns. I have always been her dependent which is reflected on all her returns. The letters I am submitting to you today are from the few acquain- tances I have. Most of these are ones which I have met through my daughter or I have had the opportunity to meet at the church that I now attend and am a member of. I have never been able to leave the United States since my ar- rival, for my daughter and other relatives were high ranking officials of the Somoza Government. My daughter was Secretary to the Minister of Defense and of General Somoza for many years. I am enclosing, along with this response, Affidavits of Knowledge from U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents, who can attest to my continuous residence in this country. I thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. Attentively, OFFICIAL SEAL Maria Matus-Hunter Notary SUVEN HUNTER Public-California I CERTIFY THAT THE ABOVE IS A TRUE AND CORRESPONDING FRANLS TOSCANGEDES COUNTY THE ATTACHED LETTER TRANSLATED FROM THE SPANISH TO THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE My AS Comm. IT Exp. IS Apr. BEST KNOWN BY ME. NOTARY PUBLIC"
