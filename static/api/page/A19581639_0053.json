On San Francisco San Francisco THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS The SUBJECT is an 85-year-old female, native and citizen of India. She first entered the United States in 1970 as a visitor and on 2-15-72 she adjusted status to permanent resident at Baltimore in the nonpreference category (NP-6). Later the same year, in October, 1972, she departed the United States. Her granddaughter, Mrs. Sohinee K. Mithaiwala, a naturalized U.S. citizen, claims she be- came ill while visiting in India and could not return in time to avoid abandoning her residence. On 12-2-78 the. SUBJECT entered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor. She was granted two exten- sions, denied a third on 1-22-80 and granted voluntary departure until 4-23-80. On 2-1-80, her granddaughter requested that the SUBJECT be allowed to remain in the United States indefinately due to her age and medical condition. The SUBJECT's doctor, V.R. Desai, 2322 Butano Dr., #100, Sacramento, CA, has advised she has spondylitis, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, glaucoma, and aphakia. The U. S. Public Health Service states spon- dylitis is the hunching of the back due to severe arthritis, osteo- porosis is a weakening of the bones due to calcium loss and aphakia is the congenital absence of the lens of the eye. According to the granddaughter there are no close relatives in India able to care for the SUBJECT. A recent questionnaire to the SUBJECT, answered by her granddaughter, indicates she is receiving Medi-Cal assistance. The Service file contains a letter from the Indian Consulate General advising that there are no facilities in India which will care for the SUBJECT. Recommend deferred action.
