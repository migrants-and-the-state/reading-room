  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 6/7/2023 Memorandum Subject Date Mr . Fonseca November 29, 1989 A28 417 099 To From Sy Kleinfeld Jack Penca General Attorney District Counsel F This case is scheduled for a master calendar hearing before Judge Horn on Thursday, November 30. I was called by Mr. Fonseca's attorney, Alsy Lomangino. She wanted to know whether I would agree to Judge Horn entering an order granting the alien one year's voluntary departure. My normal policy is not to agree to any period of voluntary departure longer than six months. However, based upon this subject's advanced age and physical condition, I am willing to make an exception to that policy in this unique case. Therefore, you are authorized to agree to a period of one year's voluntary departure in this case. Form G-2 (Rev. 1-2-80"
