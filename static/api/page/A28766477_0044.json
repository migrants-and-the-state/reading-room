  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 6/1/2023 Introduction In July 1984 the Departments of State and Defense released a study entitled Background Paper: Nicaragua's Military Build-up and Support for Central American Subversion. That study described the growth of the Sandinista military and documented the extent and sophistication of Sandinista export of subversion and support for Marxist-Leninist guerrillas elsewhere in Central America, especially in El Salvador. Since the publication of that study, the Sandinista arms build-up has accelerated. Between mid-1984 and early 1985, the active-duty force grew nearly 30 percent, from 48,000 to more than 62,000, and the tank and armored person- nel carrier inventory increased from 240 to more than 340. Moreover, the addi- tion of a radar air defense system and the Mi-24/HIND D, one of the world's most sophisticated attack helicopters, has further increased the military capability of the Sandinistas. This study describes this build-up and supplements the infor- mation on Nicaragua published in The Soviet-Cuban Connection in Central America and the Caribbean, released in March 1985. 1"
