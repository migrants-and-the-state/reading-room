  "full_text": "Memo of Info Alpha file of Genia LAUTURE March 18, 1963 Pubject in with Daughter today requesting another months to allow them to make application thru Consulate in Mexico City for Immigration Visa. Daughter is immigrated alien working as ass't head nurse at Gen. Hosp in LOS. SUBJECT has made application with help of Mex. Social Service to the Am Con in TJM. Daughter states a letter was received from TJM Consulate stating they were too busy to handle case and suggesting that subject return to her own consular district. Daughter now explains that Mex. Soc. service is trying to arrange for subject to go to Mexico City and secure an Immigrant Visa. Explained to Daughter that we will be unable to give further extension and that since her mother is not about to leave we will consider deportation. Subject has cataract on rt. eye and was slated to have operation about 2 months ago in White Memorial Hospital. Daughter deferred operation until April as Daughter has her vacation then and will be able to take care of her child whom subject is currently taking care. Daughter says her husb,nd is employed and since daughter employed there would be no hardship about securing* a baby-sitter to care for child. No financial reason that I can see that Mother (subject) can not return to. Haiti and secure her visa as others do. AFD concurs. Jaynes. 3/19/63 In again today and says is going to schedule eye surgery for mother in early part of april with White Mem. Hosp. AFD says will consider one month ext for this and this only. Attached to file are papers presented this date from Mex. Sec. Service over"
