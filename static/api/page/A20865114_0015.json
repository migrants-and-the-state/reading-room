A reference copy of your bill, WSC# 97-2274 , from the Western Region, Office of Finance has been forwarded to the California Service Center and placed in your application/petition file. United States Immigration & Naturalization Law under 8 CFR Section 103.7 states that \"Every remittance shall be accepted subject to collection. A charge of $30.00 will be imposed if a check in payment of a fee is not honored by the bank on which it is drawn. A receipt issued by a Service Officer for any such remittance shall not be binding if the remittance is found uncollectible. 11 The uncollectible status of your fee remittance check nullifies the receipt issued to you by this Service Center. All processing on your application /petition has been TERMINATED by this Service Center pending the receipt of a replacement money order. If you do not submit the required fee, plus service charge, within 14 days of the date of this letter, this case will be rejected as not having been properly filed. In addition, we may take legal action against you to collect the fee. Failure to correct this deficiency will also delay processing of any subsequent applications or petitions. PLEASE DO NOT FORWARD YOUR MONEY ORDER DIRECTLY TO THE CALIFORNIA SERVICE CENTER. Appropriate replacement fee remittances with the $30.00 uncollectible check charge should be mailed to the address below. Please reference your replacement money order with the WSC# in the upper right corner of the Office of Finance bill.
