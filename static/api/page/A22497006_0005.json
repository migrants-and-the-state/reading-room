  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 6/8/2023 What Information Does the Doctor Need to Provide on the Form N-648? The certifying doctor must answer completely and legibly all the questions in Part II of the Form N-648. The certifying doctor is not limited to the space provided on the N-648 and should attach additional sheets of paper if necessary. The most important question in Part II is question 3. The certifying doctor must provide the following three-part response to question 3. (1) A full and complete description of the doctor's diagnosis, including, if applicable, the most recent DSM code. (2) An explanation of how the disability or impairment affects the applicant and prevents him or her from learning or demonstrating knowledge of English and/or U.S. history and government. (3) The doctor's conclusion about whether the applicant is able to learn or demonstrate knowledge of English and/or U.S. history and government. What if the Form N-648 is Insufficient? If the applicant's first request for a disability exception is deemed insufficient, he or she will be provided with a Notice of Incomplete N-648 that explains why the N-648 was not accepted and given another opportunity to submit a sufficient N-648. The applicant will also be tested on English and U.S. history and government. However, if the applicant fails the tests the first time, the applicant will have another opportunity to be tested. If the applicant does not submit a sufficient N-648 within the time period specified by the Service, and cannot pass the English and U.S. history and government tests for the second time, the application for naturalization will be denied. The applicant may seek administrative review of the denied application for naturalization by filing a request for a hearing along with the required fee. This request must be filed within 30 days of receiving the denial of the application for naturalization. In seeking administrative review, the applicant may seek reconsideration of the rejected request for the disability exception (Form N-648). The applicant may rely on the Form N-648 previously submitted or may file a new or amended Form N-648 but may not submit a Form N-648 for the first time at this hearing. An INS supervisory officer will schedule a review hearing, review all information included in the record (including any new information submitted as part of the hearing process), and make a final decision on the Form N-648 and the application for naturalization. If the application for naturalization is denied after the administrative review, the applicant may seek review of the denied application in district court. N-648A (3-30-99)"
