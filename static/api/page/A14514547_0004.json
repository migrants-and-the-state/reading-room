  "full_text": "LAW OFFICES OF RICHARD T. TOSAW SEELY TOWER BUILDING 928-12TH STREET AREA CODE 209 POST OFFICE BOX 888 MODESTO, CALIFORNIA 95353 TELEPHONE 529-4505 May 21, 1965 Dear Mrs. Tosaw: Don't give up the ship -- or in this case, the airplane. I checked with the Immigration people in San Francisco and then talked to Mr. Wilson in Omaha this morning. Laws have been passed in 1936 and 1940 providing a way for you to regain your citizenship without a death certificate of your husband. Mr. Wilson wants you to bring all your papers you already have gathered - that is your small pox certificate, your pictures and your application for a passport to their office on Monday morning, May 24th, and see Mr. Johnson, an Examiner, and he will help you. The law says that if you were married and lost your citizenship, that if your marriage was eventually terminated or if you were a continuous resident of the United States, that you can regain your citizenship. If you can go there bright and early Monday morning, I am sure Mr. Johnson will take care of it and hurry it through so that you will have your passport in time. You can take this letter with you, too, if you wish. I am so sorry for this mix-up because I had hoped you would have several worry-free days before you left, but this is life, I guess. Don't worry about it, anyway, I am sure it will be all right, but kind of a close call. Your boy is still in jury trial and very busy. He seems tired, but is well. With kind regards Sliving Pethoul Shirley Pethoud Mr. Tosaw's Secretary"
