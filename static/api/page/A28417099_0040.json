  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 6/7/2023 A28 417 099 March 2, 1988 Mr. Terencio Jesus Fonseca 599 Monroe Avenue, Apt. 3 Elizabeth, NJ 07201 Dear Mr. Fonseca: On June 10, 1987 you submitted a request for asylum in the United States based upon a claim that you would face persecution were you to return to Nicaragua. A Notice of Intent to Deny dated December 11, 1987 was sent to you. Your asylum application is denied for the reasons contained in that notice and as explained below. You failed to submit any additional evidence in response to the Notice of Intent to Deny. It has been held that the burden of proof to establish eligibility sought for the benefit conferred by the Immigration laws rests upon the applicant. See Matter of Brantigan, I.D. 1553. Therefore, it is concluded that you do not qualify as a \"refugee\" within the meaning of Section 101 (a) (42) (A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, in that you failed to establish a likelihood of persecution or that you merit asylum in the exercise of discretion. There is no appeal from this decision. However, you may renew your request for asylum or apply for withholding of deportation under Section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act in proceedings before an immigration judge. As stated in the Notice of Intent to Deny, any permission to accept employment previously granted to you is hereby terminated. You are granted until April 2, 1988 to depart the United States voluntarily, at your own expense. If you do not depart on or before this date, proceedings to enforce your departure will be instituted. Please advise our Deportation section of your intended date, place, and manner of departure at least one week prior to your departure date. Any requests for extension of this date should be directed to the Deportation section. from"
