Jo Strapp, Assistant District Director Travel Control, Los Angeles, California WONG Ramon Fong Song - Possible Visa Fraud Subject has submitted a visa petition seeking second prefer- ence in behalf of Yuk-Lin Chan WONG (A18 435 377). In an interview in connection with this petition subject made an affidavit in which he stated he entered the United States at Calexico, California, on April 2, 1968, stayed one night in El Centro, California, and then came to Los Angeles where he has remained. His only employment has been as a temporary cook at Far East Terrace, North Hollywood. The visa issued to Mr. Wong was based on an approved sixth preference petition submitted by T. H. Loo dba Holly Cafe, 452 Main, E1 Centro, California. Investigation is requested to determine whether there was a bona fide job offer, whether subject intended to work as a cook at the Holly Cafe at the time of his entry into the United States, and whether the subject may now be subject to deporta- tion. The visa petition will be held in abeyance pending completion of your investigation. Please return the attached files with your report of investigation. Attachments: brown"
