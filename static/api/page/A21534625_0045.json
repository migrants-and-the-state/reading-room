	"full_text": "Screened by NARA, 18/11/2023 INSTRUCTIONS Form I-407 is designed to provide a simple procedure to record the abandonment of residence of a lawful permanent resident alien of the United States. It is used to assure that the alien is accorded due process of law and has voluntarily, willingly and affirmatively abandoned lawful permanent resident status. It also assures that the alien is informed of the right of hearing and has intelligently waived that right (in cases involving applicants for admission). Form I-407 is used by consular officers and immigration officers. It may be used for recording the facts relating to aliens interviewed in person; or by aliens who abandoned status by correspondence; or as an acknowledgement from a third person or agency. Item 1. Insert name as it appears on the Alien Registration Receipt Card if the document is presented or the information is known. Spanish surnames should be written in accordance with AM 2703.05. Item 2. List actual residence, rather than mailing address. Item 3. List by month, day, and year. Item 4. This item refers to the date the alien last departed from the United States and not necessarily when he or she abandoned lawful permanent residence. Item 5. Indicate mailing address as well as actual domicile, if different. Item 6a. This item requires a clear and concise statement in the alien's own words. It must establish beyond any reasonable doubt that the alien has voluntarily, willingly and affirmatively abandoned status as a lawful permanent resident. Item 6c. List the date the alien actually abandoned status (not necessarily the date of his or her departure from the United States. Item 6d. If the alien is not interviewed, facts relating to information received concerning abandonment of status must be explained in addition to any other pertinent information. Item 6e. Signature must be obtained in all cases in which the alien is interviewed. The officer should make every effort to assure that the alien truly understands what abandon- ment of lawful permanent resident status means. Item 7. If the alien is interviewed. the interviewing immigration/consular officer must sign the appropriate line. If feasible, the signatures of a witness, interpreter, if any, and supervisor should be obtained. Item 8. For example: \"I-151 No. A00 000 000 destroyed (Serial No. 7611459).\" Item 9. Route Form I-407 to the Files Control Office where the alien's file is located. The \"date\" block should indicate the date this form is forwarded to the Files Control Office. Item 10. If the alien is interviewed in person a copy of the completed form shall be furnished him or her at the conclusion of the interview. If abandonment of residence is accom- plished through correspondence or as an acknowiedgement from a third person or agency, a copy of the completed form shall be furnished upon request.
