Romero 76 North Robinson Avenue Portchester, NY 12550 Decision On July 0,1998, you appeared for an examination on your application for naturalization, which was filed in accordance with: Section 316 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Pursuant to the investigation and examination of your application, it is determined that you are ineligible for naturalization for the following reason(s): Section 312 of the Immigration & Nationality Act and 8CFR 312 provides in part that an applicant for naturalization must demonstrate an understanding of the English language literacy, including an ability to read, write and speak words in ordinary usage in the English language and demonstrate a knowledge of history and government of the United States. On July 20, 1998, you were accorded your first opportunity to pass your English language literacy/ government exam. On that date you failed to pass the English language literacy. Pursuant to 8CFR 312.5 you were accorded a second opportunity to pass the test on October 2, 1998. Since you failed to appear on this date, you are deemed to have failed this second examination pursuant to 8CFR 312.5. This decision is made without prejudice toward the filing of a new application in the future. It is noted that you may be eligible to apply for naturalization again on or after: April 9, 1999. If you desire to request a review hearing on this decision pursuant to Section 336(a) of the Act, you must file a request for a hearing within 30 days of the date of this notice. If no request for hearing is filed within the time allowed, this decision is final. A request for hearing may be made to the District Director, with the Immigration and Naturalization Service office which made the decision, on Form N-336, Request for Hearing on a Decision in Naturalization Proceeding under Section 336 of the Act, together with a fee of $110.00.
