Since you failed to appear on this date, you are deemed to have failed this second examination pursuant to 8CFR 312.5. This decision is made without prejudice toward the filing of a new application in the future. It is noted that you may be eligible to apply for naturalization again on or after: April 9, 1999. If you desire to request a review hearing on this decision pursuant to Section 336(a) of the Act, you must file a request for a hearing within 30 days of the date of this notice. If no request for hearing is filed within the time allowed, this decision is final.
