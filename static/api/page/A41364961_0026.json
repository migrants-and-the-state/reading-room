Glucose samples are accepted till 2.30 p.m. Emergency Electrolytes till 5.30 p.m. Note 2 Reports are given between 5-6 p.m. only or after 11 a.m. next day. Note 3. More than 12 hrs. overnight fasting condition is required for Triglycerides and Lipid Profile. Note 4. 2ml. blood is required in Fluoride bulb for glucose estimation. Note 5. 2 ml. blood is required in EDTA bulb for Haematology, G-6 P.D., Glycosylated Haemoglobin and Haemoglobin Electrophoresis. Note 6. 8-10 ml. Clotted blood or 4-5 ml. serum is required for Analyzer 26 (SMA 26). Half this quantity is required for all Hormonal tests. Outstation serum samples should be sent in ice for the same. Note 7. False elevation of LDH, Potassium, Iron and Phosphate as well as a false decrease in glucose may be seen if whole blood is received by the lab. Note 8. Bacterial contamination or delayed separation of serum from cells may falsely decrease glucose and may falsely elevate the Potassium, LDH, Phosphate, SGOT and SGPT. Note 9. Sedimentation Rate and Platelet results may be affected if the time between specimen drawing and testing is prolonged. Note 10. Hemolyzed serum may falsely elevate Potassium, Iron, SGOT, SGPT, LDH and Phosphate. Note 11. Lipemic serum may falsely elevate Chloride, Alkaline Phosphatase, SGOT, SGPT, Calcium, Total Proteins and Creatinine and may falsely lower the Total Bilirubin."
