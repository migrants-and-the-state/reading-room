Kaiser, Room 550 Special Operations Unit Office of Examiniations 7880 Biscayne Boulevard Miami, Florida 33138 Re: Gelin Dieuville Case #A72 845 268 Joseph St. Jean Dieuville Dear Examiner, The above mentioned parties have submitted themselves for DNA Paternity Testing on 02/23/94. Results will be sent to your office in approximately 6-8 weeks. As we discussed by phone on 2/24/94, at the time of the testing Mr. Joseph Dieuville did not have his Naturalization certificate as specified in your letter. However, he did provide photo identification in the form of a passport which you indicated would not pose a problem. Results reported will be highly accurate and defendable in court. All two-party cases are reported in 99th percentile of probability. Thank you for your referral, and we look forward to serving you in the future. Sincerely, Diam Sty Diane Vargo, R.N. B.S.N. Paternity Coordinator"
