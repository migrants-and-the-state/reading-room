That this affidavit is executed on behalf of Mr. Chimanlal Vithaldas Mapara and the late Mrs. Lilavati Chimanlal Mapara, presently residing at Bilimora, Gujarat State, India. 2. That I knew the late Vithaldas Nagindas Mapara and Ichachaben Vithaldas Mapara, both residents of Kadod, District of Surat, Gujarat State, India, who have a son named Chimanlal Vithaldas Mapara. 3. That I also knew the late Sundarlal Manilal Parekh and the late Gangaben Sundarlal Parekh, both residents of Kadod, District of Surat, Gujarat State, India, who had a daughter named Lilavati Chimanlal Mapara. 4. That Chimanlal, son of the late Vithaldas Nagindas Mapara, was married to the late Lilavati, daughter of the late Sundarlal Manilal Parekh at Kadod, District of Surat, Gujarat State, India, on May 13, 1931, in my presence according to Hindu rites. The same marriage was solemnized by the late Dahyabhai Joshi, resident of Kadod, District of Surat, Gujarat State, India. 5. That at that time, in the year 1931, the Marriage Act was not enforced and as such the said marriage was not registered in Government Records. The Marriage Act came into force only in the year 1955. Hence, the marriage certificate is not available and therefore this affidavit has been executed by me. 6. That I, being the nearest friend of Chimanlal V. Mapara's family, know the above facts very well, by my personal knowledge. 7. That I know that a false affidavit is a criminal offense.
