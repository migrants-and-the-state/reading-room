Please type or print your last name, first name, and middle name on the bottom of page 2 of the Form N-648. Please type or print your business address and telephone number on the bottom of page 2 of the Form N-648. Please type or print your license number and licensing state on the bottom of page 2 of the Form N-648. Other The following are examples of incomplete responses to question # 3 - (a) The patient is a 75-year-old female who has hypertension and heart disease. She has suffered at least 2 heart attacks, once in 1996 and in 1997. Last year, she had a cerebral vascular accident (i.e. stroke) with paralysis on the left side. She is unable to learn English and basic U.S. history and civics. (Note: The doctor failed to articulate how any of the conditions listed affect for example, the patient's memory, ability to learn new tasks, ability to concentrate, or ability to perform basic mental activities, and therefore failed to show that the applicant's condition has so impaired her functioning that she is unable to learn or demonstrate knowledge of English and/or U.S. history and government.) (b) The patient suffers from Down's Syndrome. He should be exempted from the English language and U.S. civics requirements for civics. (Note: The certifying doctor failed to identify the DSM Code, explain how the condition affects the applicant's ability to learn, and give, an ultimate opinion on whether the condition diagnosed prevents the applicant from learning or demonstrating knowledge of English and/or civics.) The following are examples of complete responses to question # 3 -- (a) The patient is a 75-year-old female who has hypertension and heart disease. She has suff√®red at least 2 heart attacks, once in 1996 and in 1997. Last year, she had a cerebral vascular accident (i.e. stroke) with paralysis on the left side. he patient's stroke has left her with severe and irreversible neurological damage. Because of the widespread damage to the rain tissue, she has suffered markedly decreased cerebral function and is incapable of remembering, articulating, or learning. n my professional. medical opinion, the patient is unable to learn basic English and U.S. history and civics because of her nental and physical condition. (Note: The certifying doctor identified the diagnosis, explained the effect the condition has on le applicant's ability to learn, and attested that the diagnosed condition prevents the applicant from learning or emonstrating knowledge of English and civics.) (b) The patient suffers from Down's Syndrome, DSM Code 318.1, which is a global impairment that affects the atient's cognition, language, and motor skills. Because of the patient's global impairment, he cannot learn new skills and is )t capable of reasoning. His memory is deficient, and he is only capable of performing simple daily activities. In my ofessional medical opinion, the patient is incapable of learning a new language (even basic new words of a new language) id U.S. history and civics because of his mental disability. (Note: The certifying doctor provided the mental impairment, cluding the DSM Code, an explanation for how the condition affects the applicant's ability to learn, and a conclusion that impairment prevents the applicant from learning or demonstrating knowledge of English and civics.)
