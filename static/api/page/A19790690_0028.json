WILLIAMS, M.D. PHYSICIAN & SURGEON 72 OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY 343 MEDICAL CENTER BUILDING EUGENE, OREGON 97401 January 14, 1972 ORGE Mr. William Pattillo District Director of Immigration Department of Justice Court House Portland, Oregon Re: Dieu Xuan McGeever Dear Mr. Pattillo: The above patient of mine has asked for a letter regarding her mother who is to be deported. Mrs. McGeever recently delivered her first child by Cesarean section following a complicated labor problem. She is a very nervous, tense, and dependent person who is in continued need of physical and psychological support. For these reasons, she requires the constant attention that her mother can provide, They are unable to afford other types of household help, I believe that both the child and Mrs. McGeever would suffer and be under unusual strain and hardship if they were deprived her mother's help and I, therefore, would request that you delay deportation of this lady, Sincerely yours, cen CSW:mr"
