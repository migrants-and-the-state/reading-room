You are advised to read the information and instructions printed in the Refugee Travel Document. Your attention is called to Section 6851 (d) of Title 26, United States Code which reads as follows: \"No alien shall depart from the United States unless he first procures from the Secretary or his delegate a certificate that he has complied with all the obligations imposed upon him by the income tax laws\". It is suggested that you call at or communicate with your local office of the District Director of Internal Revenue, United States Treasury Department, for information concerning such a certificate. This should be done within 30 days of the date of your proposed departure from the United States. Requirements for entry into and departure from countries on your itinerary should be ascertained from em- bassies or consulates of those countries well in advance of your scheduled travel. Your attention is also called to Section 265 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This law requires that every alien in the United States during January of each year shall notify the Attorney General, in writing, of his cur- rent address and furnish such additional information as may by regulations be required. During January of each year appropriate forms are available from any United States Rost office or Immigration and Naturalization Service office. Any alien temporarily absent from the United States during January of any year shall furnish his current address and other information as required within ten (10) days after his return. Any alien temporarily absent from the United States during January of any year, upon his return to the United States should call, in person, at the nearest Immi- gration and Naturalization Service office to secure and execute the required form. Failure to comply with this law can result in fine and imprisonment.
