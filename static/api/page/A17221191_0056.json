In the past, less than one out of twenty-five applicants for evaluation have been found to have active disease requiring hospitalization; nevertheless, the sponsor must realize that the possibility of treatment being needed exists before making final arrangements. Any information from the applicant's physician in his or her previous country of residence will be helpful in making the preliminary decision. THE BARLOW SANATORIUM AND HOSPITAL 2000 Stadium Way 11/68 Los Angeles, California 90026 Telephone: 628-4165"
