Rivkind District Director U. S. Department of Justice DEPARTMENT A 7880 Biscayne Blvd. Miami, Florida 33138 Dear Mr. Rivkind, Your Service has requested our views on the Application for Asylum in the United States for the above-named person. We have carefully reviewed the information submitted as part of the application. On this basis, we believe that the applicant has failed to establish a well-founded fear of being persecuted in Nicaragua, on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, as provided in the United Nations Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Consequently, the applicant does not appear to qualify for asylum. In the event the applicant submits additional information or your office otherwise acquires it, which you believe requires further consideration, we would be pleased to review the matter in light of such new data. Sincerely, Leon Johnson Leon M. Johnson, Director Office of Asylum Affairs Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs"
