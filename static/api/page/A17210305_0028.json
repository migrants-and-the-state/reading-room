  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 7/11/2023 May 4, 1967 A17 179 121 Chief, Visa Section American Consulate General Frankfurt, Germany Dear Sir: Attached please find approved visa petition filed by Mrs. Sema Joy Lacks, a citizen of the United States, in behalf of her brother, Michael Josefi, a native of India, presently residing in West Germany with his wife and step- daughter, both natives of Germany. The beneficiary would appear, therefore, to be entitled to the benefits of section 202(b)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amend- ed, under the fifth preference of the quota for Germany. It would also follow, of course, that the wife and stepchild, if necessary, could be accorded the same fifth preference under section 203(a)(9). A visa petition by this petitioner for this same beneficiary was approved at this office on July 12, 1954 under visa petition number VP-16-6629. The petitioner be- lieves that this petition at one time was forwarded to the American Consul, Vancouver, B.C., Canada. Rather than attempt to locate the 1954 petition and have it revalidated, the petitioner has elected to file a new petition in view of the availability of the German quota. This office has no record of the prior petition but the petitioner has presented a letter from this office dated July 12, 1954, addressed to her advising of the approval of the petition for her brother. Sincerely, SKR George K. Rosenberg District Director Encl."
