Did you explain to the American Consulate in Rio de Janeiro that you had been denied an immigrant visa by the American Consulate in Sao Paulo the previous month? NOTE: Attorney has objected to alien's answer to question asked by Immigrant Inspector. Q. As your attorney has objected to that question, did you inform the American Consulate that you had applied for an immigrant visa at the American Consulate in Sao Paulo, Brazil? A. I didn't inform the Consulate in Rio de Janiero. We were plann- ing as temporary tourists as I told you, because we had to catch up the time for FOIA (b)(6) Q.

Now is this correct Sir? NOTE: Lawyer views evidence in question Q. Now Mr. Bonapart have you thoroughly viewed the evidence in question? ATT'Y. I have. Q.

A. I feel that the tourist application cane up very suddenly and we thought that we couldn't get the tourist visa and I put the answer on that the resident I was a resident in Rio but not so many years as we went in Sao Paulo, and I realize that didn't mean very much to the Consulate approval as a tourist. The main point is if we can get the tourist visa and certainly we were, by the law as, a tourist, and I can realize that I didn't realize that the -5-"
