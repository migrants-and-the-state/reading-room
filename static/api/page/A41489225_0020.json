CONSULATE GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IMPORTANT - This document must be read and signed by persons wishing to submit an affidavit of support on behalf of an alien applying for an immigrant visa. A signed copy of this document must be attached to each copy of any affidavit of support submitted on behalf of an applicant. The Social Security Act, as amended, establishes certain requirements for determining the eligibility of aliens for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits. These amendments require that the income and resources of any person who as the sponsor of an alien's entry into the United States, executed an affidavit of support or similar agreement on behalf of the alien, and the income and resources of the sponsor's spouse, shall be deemed to be the income and resources of the alien under formulas for determining eligi- bility for SSI and AFDC benefits during the three years following the alien's entry into the United States. The eligibility of aliens for SSI and AFDC will be contingent upon their obtaining the co- operation of their sponsor in providing the necessary information and evidence to enable the Social Security Administration and State Welfare Agencies to carry out this provision. An alien applying for SSI or AFDC must make available to the Social Security Administration and/or State Welfare Agency documentation concerning his income or resources or those of his sponsors, including in- formation which he provided in support of his application for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to obtain copies of any such documentation from other agencies. The Social Security Act also provides that an alien and his or her sponsor shall be jointly and severally liable to repay any SSI and AFDC benefits which are incorrectly paid because of misinformation provided by sponsor or because of sponsor's failure to provide information, and any incorrect payments which are not repaid will be withheld from any subsequent payments for which the alien or sponsors are otherwise eligible under the Social Security Act. These provisions do not apply to aliens admitted as refugees or granted political asylum by the Attorney General. They also will not apply to the SSI eligibility of aliens who become blind or disabled after entry into the United States. The AFDC provisions do not apply to aliens who are dependent children of the sponsor or sponsor's spouse. I, RUSTAM H IRANi residing at 1725 ESPLANADE AVE. ANT\" (name) (Street and number) New ORLEANS LOUISIANA , acknowledge that I have read (City) (State) the above and am aware of my responsibilities as an immigrant sponsor under the Social Security Act as amended. This statement is submitted on behalf of the following persons: NAME SEX AGE COUNTRY MARRIED RELATIONSHIP OF BIRTH OR SINGLE TO SPONSOR(S) MRS FRENY H.
