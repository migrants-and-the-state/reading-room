Rivkind, District Director Immigration and Naturalization Service 7880 Biscayne Boulevard Miami, Florida 33138 Dear Mr. Rivkind: This is in response to your letter asking for an advisory opinion on the above applicant's request for asylum in the United States. Upon careful review of the information submitted and assuming the facts of this case as stated in the application are true, it is our view that the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Nicaragua within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. I trust that this advisory opinion will be helpful in reaching a decision in this case. Sincerely Edward H. Wilkinson, Director Office of Asylum Affairs Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs"
