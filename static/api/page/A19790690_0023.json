Pattillo District Director Immigration and Naturalization Service 333 U.S. Courthouse Portland, Oregon 97205 Dear Mr. Pattillo: I am writing in support of my mother-in-law, Mrs. Nguyen Thi Nhat, who is applying for an extension of stay in the United States. As you may remember you reopened the case of Mrs. Nhat's application this past January 19. The circumstances surrounding the case have not changed since then. That is to say, Mrs. Nhat is an elderly widow with no other family to turn to, and my wife depends on her emotionally. She would suffer greatly if she and her mother were separated. So we trust that you will grant Mrs. Nhat's appli- cation for an extension of stay. Thank you very much, Sincerely yours, James M.M.Goever James M. McGeever Encs. Form I-94 of Mrs. Nguyen Thi Nhat. Ten dollar check for application fee."
