S. had to defer his departure home at the end of the stipulated period of four months on grounds of failing physical health. He suffers from diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney failure. He is under treatment for both at present, and hopefully he will respond to treatment. His prognosis is uncertain and therefore, the period of his further stay in this country remains equally uncertain. A supplementary medical certificate will be issued within the next few months as indicated. Sincerely yours, Donal Zundma DF/1p DANIEL FRIEDMAN, M.D. Deputy Director"
