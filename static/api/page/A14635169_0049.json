Sender: 406 Shanghai St., 1st floors Kowloon, Hong Kong Addressee: Mrs. Philip Chow, 445 W. School St., Compton, Califo,NoS.A. CONTENTS May 23, (1953) Ching: Received your letter couple days ago. I am very glad that you told Yuk Wing you agree to buy a car. we are all very happy. This would certainly help the family and relieve you. So far we still haven*t find the right one to buy yet. Jick Fai brothers were looking for a British-made or German-made because they will be more durable and easy to change parts. American-made or Japan-made cars look gorgeous but it is very difficult to change parts. We found some cars quite good, but the price was agreeable. We intend to buy a used one, 80 or 60 percent new one, because it would be easier to find. But a used car probably needs to be repaired from time to time, which will present a problem, because the purpose of buying a car is to use it to make a living. In your letter you stated that you sent $200.00 for Mom's use, but I BE afraid to use it DCN before we buy 8 car. After we bought the car, I will go to uncle Chiu Suey's place to cash it. After we bought the car, we have to buy auto insurance on mouthly basis, because everybody is doing the same. will write to you again later when we found a car to buy. Oriental Cafe is an old building, more than 80 years old. The Government has issued notice to the landlord to demolish the building, but the landlord wouldn't do it, 80 that the government will take action to tear down the building. All occupants have to move out of the building before August 31. All business occupants have to move out before September 30. We decide to move out in the middle of August. Just to let you know. If you have pictures, please send US some at your convenience, All of us afe fine. Please don't worry. will again. Kindest regards to you all.
