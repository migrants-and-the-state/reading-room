I was a housewife, and I left Nicaragua, because my daughter sent for me, and because I was alone in Nicaragua without any relative I came here. Another reason why I am here is because I do not share the communists ideas that Nicaragua is having since the communists got there, and that is why my daughter left Nicaragua, and in a way I left the country for the same reason. 3. Why did you leave your home country or country of nationality? Another reason why I left Nicaragua, is that I was afraid that the sandinistas will sent me to a place apart where I will never heard of my relatives anymore, and where the sandinistas put the old people, and because I did not want to die in a place like that is why I am here"
