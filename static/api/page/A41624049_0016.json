He is a pleasant 83 year old gentleman, who has been under my care for Asthma, Hypertension and C.O.P.D. Because of his age he also has learning difficulties and is hard of hearing. I do not believe that the patient is capable of learning English as a second language with sufficient proficiency to pass the required citizenship test in English. Please allow this gentleman to take the Citizenship test in his native language, Spanish. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at the number on the letterhead during office hours 9:30 am to 5:30 pm M-F. Sincerely, Arturo Velazquez Jr/ M.D. 417 E. Merced Avenue .
