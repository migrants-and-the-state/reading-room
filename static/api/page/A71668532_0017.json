This patient has a history of congestive heart failure, hypertensive cardio vascular disease, puerperal edema and degenerative joint disease of lumbar spine. Because of her age with her heart problems I feel she is incapable of remembering or learning English, Civics and US History. She cannot speak any English and is confined to a wheelchair due to her back and legs. If you have any questions please call this office. Thank You Alan B. Mickish, M.D."
