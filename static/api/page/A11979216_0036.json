Service 510 South Vermont Avenue Los Angeles, California Gentlemen: After having fulfilled all requirements requested by the American Consulate in Managua, Nicaragua, I was granted visa to migrate to the United States as a perma- nent resident. This was four months ago. I was admitted at the port of Los Angeles on July 29, 1960. I have now found myself involved in a suit for pay- ment of money, by a party who claims to have been instru- mental in helping me obtain certain documents said to have been required. This has been a shock to me since there are at least two documents which I do not recall ever seeing nor handling. In view of the above and for my personal information I would be grateful if you could send me a list of all documents under my name and Alien Reg. No. 11-979-216. A prompt reply would be very much appreciated as I will need this information prior to my appearance in court on November 30, 1960. Yours very truly, Delia Delgado Address: DELIA ISABEL DELGADO-OCAMPO 1315 West 9th Street, Apt. 209 Los Angeles 15, California"
