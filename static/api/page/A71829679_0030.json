THIS SECTION TO BE COMPLETED BY A LICENSED MEDICAL DOCTOR, DOCTOR OF OSTEOPATHY, OR LICENSED CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST (see Instructions) Purpose of this Form: The individual named above is applying to become a United States citizen. Applicants for naturalization are required to learn and/or demonstrate knowledge of the English language, including an ability to read, write, and speak words in ordinary usage in the English language, as well as knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, and of the principles and form of government of the United States. Individuals who are unable, because of a disability, to learn and/or demostrate this required knowledge may apply for a waiver. The purpose of this form is to help determine whether your patient is eligible for this waiver. Definition of Disability: An individual is eligible for this waiver if he or she is unable to learn and/or demonstrate knowledge of English and/or U.S. history and civics because of a physical or mental impairment (or combination of impairments). These impairments must result from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities, which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. The impairment(s) must result in functioning so impaired as to render an individual unable to demonstrate the required knowledge. NOTE: This definition of disability is different from the definition used by the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, or worker's compensation programs. If your responses do not address the applicant's disability for the purposes of naturalization, we will require the applicant to submit a revised or second form with the appropriate information. Provide all of the following required information, using common terminology that a person without medical training can understand, with no abbreviations. Type or print clearly. Illegible and incomplete forms will be returned. If you need additional space to provide your answers, attach additional pages.
