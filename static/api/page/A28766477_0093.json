  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 6/1/2023 THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON January 24, 1984 Dear FOIA (b)(6) Thank you for your message of support following the actions we took to restore order and democracy in Grenada. A few years ago it seemed that America forgot what an admirable and essential need there is for a nation to have men and women who would give their lives to protect their fellow citizens and to defend the freedom we hold so dear. Today, it is clear that our national security can be threatened in faraway places, but it is equally clear that we are blessed with the resources and will to fulfill our responsibilities in the pursuit of peace and justice. As one of the medical students rescued from Grenada said here at the White House to representatives of our Armed Forces involved in this rescue mission, \"We owe each and every one of you a debt we can never repay. I believe that this student was speaking a thought in the minds and hearts of all Americans. The process of restoring self-determination and democracy in Grenada is now underway, and its completion will mark the most fitting monument to the sacrifices of our brave young men. Their valor will never be forgotten. Thank you, and God bless you. Sincerely, Ronald Reagan FOIA (b)(6)"
