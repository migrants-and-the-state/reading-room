Q It is noted that you use the name WONG, FONG SONG. A That is a different dialect. Q Well how do you account for the change? Your Form I-151 apparently was issued under the name WONG, RAMON FONG SONG, which is not your true name, inasmuch as your true name is WONG CHUN SUM. A That name was one that was given me during my life in Mexico and I have used it as my name."
