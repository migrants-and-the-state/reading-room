  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 7/7/2023 RENE J. RODRIGUEZ, M. D., P. A. DIPLOMATE, AMERICAN BOARD OF RADIOLOGY DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY 1701 W. FLAGLER STREET - SUITE 5 - MIAMI, FLORIDA 33125 PHONES: (305) 643-4747 / 643-4748 TO : FRANCISCO MUGUERCIA, M.D. REF. PATIENT : TARCILA ROMERO CONTROL No. : 19971 DATE OF X-RAY : 5-27-87 PROCEDURE : CHEST x-ray examination of the above patient as indicated by you showed the following findings: CHEST: Fibrocalcific changes, residual from old granulomatous disease are identified at the right upper lobe, with loss of volume and secondary shifting of the upper mediastinal structures and cardiac silhouette toward the right side. There is also slight old, residual pleural thickening along the lateral aspect and base of the right hemithorax, with blunting of the costophrenic angle and slight secondary elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. A small, residual calcified granuloma is seen projected on the mid-lateral aspect of the left lung field, which is otherwise somewhat hyperexpanded. As mentioned before all these changes represent residual, non- active changes. From the radiograhic standpoint there is no evidence of any active or acute pulmonary or pleural disease. There is slight unfolding of aorta. The cardiac silhouette is somewhat difficult to evaluate properly, being most likely borderline in size or minimally enlarged and showing slight left ventricular configuration. There is moderate generalized osteoporosis in keeping with patient's age. RR:ac Rene J. Rodriguez, M.D."
