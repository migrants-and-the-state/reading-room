  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 9/21/2023 NOTICE TO RESPONDENT ANY STATEMENT YOU MAKE MAY BE USED AGAINST YOU IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS THE COPY OF THIS ORDER SERVED UPON YOU IS EVIDENCE OF YOUR ALIEN REGISTRATION WHILE YOU ARE UNDER DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS. THE LAW REQUIRES THAT IT BE CARRIED WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES If you so choose, you may be represented in this proceeding, at no expense to the Government, by an attorney or other individual authorized and qualified to represent persons before the Immigration and Naturalization Service. You should bring with you any affidavits or other documents which you desire to have considered in connection with your case. If any document is in a foreign language, you should bring the original and certi- fied translation thereof. If you wish to have the testimony of any witnesses considered, you should arrange to have such witnesses present at the hearing. When you appear you may, if you wish; admit that the allegations contained in the Order to Show Cause are true and that you are deportable from the United States on the charges set forth therein. Such admission may constitute a waiver of any further hearing as to your deportability. If you do not admit that the allegations and charges are true, you will be given reasonable opportunity to present evidence on your own behalf, to examine the Government's evidence, and to cross-examine any witnesses presented by the Government. You may apply at the hearing for voluntary departure in lieu of deportation. Moreover, if you appear to be eligible to acquire lawful permanent resident status the special inquiry office will explain this to you at the hearing and give you an opportunity to apply. You will be asked during the hearing to select a country to which you choose to be deported in the event that your deportation is required by law. The special inquiry officer will also notify you concerning any other country or countries to which your deportation may be directed pursuant to law; and upon receipt of this information, you will have an opportunity to apply during the hearing for temporary withholding of deportation if you believe you would be subject to persecution in any such country on account of race, religion, or political opinion. Failure to attend the hearing at the time and place designated hereon may result in your arrest and detention by the Immigration and Naturalization Service without further notice, or in a determination being made by the special inquiry officer in your absence. REQUEST FOR PROMPT HEARING To expedite determination` my case, I request an immediate hearing, and waive any right I may have to more extended notice.
