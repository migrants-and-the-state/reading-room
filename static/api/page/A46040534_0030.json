  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 6/15/2023 SPONSOR'S FINANCIAL RESPONS IBILITY UNDER THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT IMPORTANT: This document must be read and signed by persons wishing to submit an affidavit of support on behalf of an alien applying for an immigrant visa. A signed copy of this document must be attached to any affidavit of support submitted on behalf of an applicant. The Social Security Act, as amended, establishes certain requirements for determining the eligibility of aliens for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits. The Food Stamp Act, as amended, contains similar provisions. These amendments require that the income and resources of any person (and that person's spouse) who executes an affidavit of support of similar agreement on behalf of an Immigrant alien be deemed to be the income and resources of the alien under formulas for determining eligibility for SSI, AFDC, and Food S tamp benefits during the three years following the alien's entry into the United S tates. The eligibility of aliens for SSI,, AFDC, and Food Stamp benefits will be contingent upon their obtaining the cooperation of their sponsors in providing the necessary information and evidence to enable the Social Security Administration and/or State Welfare Agencies to carry out these provisions. An alien applying for SSI, AFDC, or Food Stamp benefits must make available to the Social Security Administration and/or State Welfare Agencies documentation concerning his or her income or resources or those of his or her sponsors, including information which he or she provided in support of his or her application for an Immigrant visa or adjustment of status. The Secretary of Health and Human Services and/or State Welfare Agencies are authorized to obtain copies of any such documentation from other agencies. The Social Security Act and the Food tamp Act also provide that an alien and his or her sponsor shall be jointly and severally liable to repay any SSI, AF DC, and Food Stamp benefits which are incorrectly paid because of misinformation provided by sponsor or because of sponsor's failure to provide information. Also, any incorrect payments of SSI and AFDC benefits which are not repaid will be withheld from any subsequent payments for which the alien or sponsors are otherwise eligible under the Social Security Act. These provisions do not apply to aliens admitted as refugees or granted political asylum by the Attorney General. They also will not apply to the SSI eligibility of aliens who become blind or disabled after entry into the United States. The AFDC provisions do not apply to aliens who are dependent children of the sponsor or sponsor's spouse. I/we ADINO BLADIMIR CRUZ , residing at 20288 PORTSIDE DR.
