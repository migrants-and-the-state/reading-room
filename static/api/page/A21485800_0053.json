McCleskey Deputy District Director United States Department of Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service 1280 W. Peachtree Street, N. W. Atlanta, Georgia 30309 Dear Mr. McCleskey: Please refer to my enclosed letter dated April 19, 1976. This is a follow up of this letter. My parents Mr. C. S. Pinjani and Mrs. S. B. Pinjani have arrived in Huntsville, Alabama on visitor visa on May 1, 1976, since they could not wait any longer for the immigration visa, to be processed. I am therefore, now requesting that for their immigration visa, the port of issue of the visa on their petition be changed from New Delhi, India to Atlanta, Georgia. I am also enclosing their passports for your consideration (requesting change of visitor visa to immigrant visa). Please let me know if I can provide you with any more information of if I need to fill further application blanks. Once again will you kindly return my high school certificate and my citizen- ship papers. I need these for other purposes. Also, will you please send us back the passports of my parents after you have duly examined them. Thank you. Sincerely, Moti Pinjani, D. V. M., Ph.D Associate Professor MP/mh"
