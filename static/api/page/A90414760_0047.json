Instructions To ensure the INS of the integrity of the fingerprint cards submitted by applicants for benefits, all DFS fingerprinters must fill out an attestation on Form I-850A each time they take fingerprints for an immigration benefit applicant. The DFS's fingerprinters are required to execute the attestations in duplicate, giving the original copy to the person being fingerprinted and keeping the second copy, which may be a reproduced copy of the original attestation, on file for at least 3 months for Service inspection. Attestations must be submitted on Form I-850A, Attestation by Designated Fingerprinting Service Certified to Take Fingerprints. Reproduced copies of Form I-850A are acceptable. Reporting Burden.
