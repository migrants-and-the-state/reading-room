Dementia (Alzheimary type) (b) Provide the relevant DSM-IV code(s) for each mental impairment that you described above. If a DSM-IV code does not exist, write \"N/A.\" CONNECTION BETWEEN IMPAIRMENT(S) AND INABILITY TO LEARN/DEMONSTRATE KNOWLEDGE The law requires that applicants for citizenship demonstrate (1) an understanding of the English language, including the ability to read, and speak simple words and phrases in ordinary usage; and (2) a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of U.S. history and civics. An applicant's difficulty in fulfiling the requirements is not sufficient to support a waiver. In addition, illiteracy in the applicant's native language is not sufficient, by itself, to support a finding of inability to learn and/or demonstrate knowledge. 3. Based on your examination of the applicant, provide detailed information on the connection between the impairment(s) and the applicant's inability to learn and/or demonstrate knowledge of English and/or U.S. history and civics (see Instructions for examples). Note: This description should address the severity of the effects of the impairment(s) including the specific limitations that affect the applicant's ability to learn and/or demonstrate knowledge. 93 yof with Alzhimers disease resulting in severa dementia pt can't learn any skills Nov can she perform any task she requires total cave 1 Form N-648 (Rev. 04/09/02)N Page 2"
