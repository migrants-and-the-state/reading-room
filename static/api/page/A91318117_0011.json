Applications which were based in whole or in part on affidavit evidence and were denied based upon insufficient documentation were reopened sua sponte to provide the opportunity to submit additional documentation, including but not limited to affidavit evidence. You were notified of the Service's intent to reopen your case as referenced above. However, upon reviewing your application and supporting documentation it was found that your case should not have been reopened. 8 CFR 245a. (2) states in part: Eligibility. The following categories of aliens who are otherwise eligible to apply for legalization may file for adjustment to temporary residence status: (2) An alien who establishes that he or she entered the United States as a nonimmigrant prior to January 1, 1982, and whose period of authorized admission expired through the passage of time prior to January 1, 1982, and who has thereafter resided continuously in the United States in an unlawful status, and who has been physically present in the United States from November 6, 1986, until the date of filing the application. 8 CFR 245a. 2 (d) states in part: \"Documentation. Evidence to support an alien's eligibility for the legalization program shall include documents establishing proof of identity, proof of residence, and proof of financial responsibility, as well as photographs, a completed fingerprint card (Form FD-258) and a complete medical report of examination (Form I-693). All documentation submitted will be subject to Service verification. Applications submitted with unverifiable documentation may be denied. Failure by an applicant to authorize release to INS of information protected by the Privacy Act and/or related laws in order for INS to adjudicate a claim may result in denial of the benefit sought...' 11"
