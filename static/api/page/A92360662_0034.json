CONCLUSION: As a result of the following mental and physical impairment patient's participation in English and Civics classes is not possible. Moreover, the patient is not able to use audio tapes to study in her own. 1. Osteoarthritis of lumbar vertebral and lower extremities joints limits the patient's ability to attend classes. 2. Dementia and her multiple physical disability make her unable to learn new concepts. Therefore I recommend to waive Civics and English tests for her. BRUCE TORKAN M. D."
