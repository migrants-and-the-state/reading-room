I am now an American citizen. Maria Bravo is my aunt and I have seen her at least once per week since the time that she has not lived with me. She arrived in the United States (Los Angeles, California) in 1970 and has lived here ever since. When she first arrived she lived with my cousin, Aura Cantarero, her niece, for three years. Then in 1973 she came to live with my mother, her sister Angelica Bravo Rivas and myself. She lived with us for ten years until 1983. From then on she has lived with her two sisters, Zoila Mena and Blanca Bravo in their home in Montebello, California. The information I have disclosed is to the best of my know- ledge.
