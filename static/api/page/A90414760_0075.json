We have examined the application carefully, interviewed the sub- ject under oath. The alien does not clearly establish that she would be subject to persecution because of race, nationality, political opinion, religion or membership in a social group. The subject does not present satisfactory evidence to establish that she will be persecuted if she returns to Nicaragua. In accordance with our regulations, we are submitting the appli- cation and addendum for your consideration It is our intent to deny the application. No final determination will be made, however, until we receive your advisory opinion. Sincerely, Perry A. Rivkind District Director Enclosure"
