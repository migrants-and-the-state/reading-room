  "full_text": "DETAILS SUBJECT is presently residing at 639 South Stanford Avenue, Los Angeles, California. SUBJECT was admitted as an 0-1 immigrant at El Paso, Texas on August 18, 1955 upon presentation of an immigrant visa secured from the American Consul in Juarez, Chih., Mexico. There is attached to and made a part of the immigrant visa an affidavit of employment allegedly signed by VENCE SEGULIA, JR. subscribed and sworn to before EUCEBIO B. LEON and a document from the County Tax Assessor's office showing evaluation of property owned by SEGULIA. The general context of the letter of employment indicates that it is one that was written by CEFERINO ANCHONDO who has been convicted of furnishing fraudulent documents to prospective immigrants and is serving a three years' sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, La Tuna, Texas. Also, Thistate-District Attorney has requested and obtained a cancella- tion of Phenotarial seal of EUCEBIO B. LEON for having signed as a notary documents in which the affiants did not appear before him or in which the signatures of the affiants were forgeries. On June 19, 1956 a statement was taken from Mr. VENCE SEGULTA, JR. in which he stated that the signature appearing in the letter of employment was not his signature and that he was not acquainted with the SUBJECT and that he had not signed any such documents before Notary Public EUCEBIO B. LEON or CEFERINO ANCHONDO. A copy of his statement is attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\". EX \"A\" The immigrant visa shows that the SUBJECT was destined to 620 Ochoa Street in El Paso and not to the SEGULTA Farm which is located some distance from El Paso, Texas. On July 3, 1956 a letter was addressed to ENRIQUE DE LA HOYA in Villa Ignacio Ramirez, Dgo., Mexico, father of the SUBJECT, requesting information as to the whereabouts of the SUBJECT. Information has been received showing that VICENTE DE LA HOYA resides at 629 South Stanford Avenue, Los Angeles, California. El Paso, Texas 8/14/56 A10 534 184 -2-"
