Los Angeles, Street Los Angeles, California Dear Sir: My mother, Bibi (houdhry, applied for a change of status to that of permanent resident and I filed a petion for her. This was done in early March. In April we came for the interview and were informed that proof of my citizanship and financial responsibility statements were needed. These statements and my naturalization papers were left at the dask with one of the secretaries.. It has been about four months since these statements were submitted and we have received no word.. Perhaps these papers have been misplaced.. I would like to especialy have my naturalization certificate returned.. Sincerely, Rashidul Rashidul Z. (houdhny 2.
