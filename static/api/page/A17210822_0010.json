Ress, M.D. May 18, 1971 Please be advised that Mrs. Esther Meyer, a patient in our Medical Clinic, is under active medical care for chronic congestive heart failure and has been since 1966. She is 86 years of age and requires continuous medical supervision by us as well as the constant supervision and attention of her son, Mr. Joseph Meyer. It would be extremely hazardous for her fragile state of health for her to undertake an extended journey. For these reasons, it is respectfully requested that Mrs. Meyer be permitted to remain in the United States. Please feel free to contact us at any time in this regard. Very truly yours, Richard M. Ress, M.D."
