TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain performed on a 1.5T GE scanner, with S ttal and axial T1W, axial T2W and axial FLAIR. FINDINGS: There is little enlargement of the lateral ventricles. The cerebral sulci are enlarged, mainly in the high parietal lobes and to a lesser extent inn the frontal lobes. There is also widening of the sylvian fissures related to temporal lobe atrohy. A number of small white matter hyperintensities are scattered through the centrum semiovale of the crebral hemispheres. These are not confluent. No mass or bleed is visible The posterior fossa is normal. CONCLUSION: There is generalized cerebral atrophy that is most prominent in the parietal lobes. There are also multiple small white matter ischemic foci. The dementia is probably related to this combination, with the ischemic lesions probably less significant than the general atrophy. John R. Bentson, M.D. (signed 10/11/98 at 13:23)"
