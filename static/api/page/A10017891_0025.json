  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 9/6/2023 wish to make a statement that might interfere with his finishing that school; that he has now graduated. On August 4, 1966, SUBJECT LEE Suey Gin made a sworn statement. She stated she is a native and citizen of China, born September 20, 1910 at Yu Ai Hung Village, SND; married; employed as a packer at the Seiler Company, Boston, Mass., and resides at 102 Norway Street, Boston. She stated that her father's name was LEE Shek Loy and her mother's name was HOM Toy Siu; that they were both natives and citizens of China and never resided in the United States; that they both died in China. She stated that her parents had two children by their marriage, herself and a son, LEE Lung Fay, who resides in China and never lived in this country. Regarding her marriage, she testified the same as her husband, SUBJECT WONG Gim Lee. She stated she made only one entry into the United States and that was on February 13, 1955 at Anchorage, Alaska where she was admitted as the spouse of a United States citizen. She stated that when she applied for an immigrant visa to come to the United States she was told by her husband to state that his name was OI Gim Lee and not WONG, and to list her children using the surname OI and not WONG. She stated she did not know too much about citizenship; that her husband always told her that he had used the name \"OI\" in the United States. She now testifies that she knows she entered the United States illegally when she was admitted as a spouse of a United States citizen, as her husband has now informed her that he is not a citizen of this country. SUBJECT WONG Gim Lee filed for a certificate of citizenship but it was denied for lack of prosecution by the Citizenship Branch, Boston. Boston, Mass., 8-9-66 A-12 738 876; A-10 017 891"
