I am aware that the knowing placement of false information on the Form N-648 and related documents may also subject me to civil penalties under 8 U.S.C. Section 1324c. Signature Matilde Roman Date 11/13/01 PART II. THIS SECTION TO BE COMPLETED BY A LICENSED MEDICAL DOCTOR OR LICENSED CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST (see instructions) The individual named above is applying for an exception from the English language and/or U.S. history and civics tests required of applicants for naturalization. The Immigration and Naturalization Service's regulations require that applicants for an exception based on disability submit this certification form, completed by a licensed medical doctor or licensed clinical psychologist, along with a completed application for naturalization (Form N-400). Please answer the following questions as clearly and completely is possible using common terminology and compiere words and phrases. 1. Date of your most recent examination of the applicant. 10/23/01 2. Is this your first examination of the individual? Yes No X If yes, who is the regular attending physician? 3. Based on your examination, describe any findings of a physical or mental disability or impairment which, in your professional medical opinion, would prevent this applicant from demonstrating knowledge of basic English language and/or U.S. history and civics. Describe in detail. If applicant has a mental disability or impairment, please provide DSM diagnosis. Matilde Romano has a number of medical problems including diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease and osteoarthritis. Her peripheral vascular disease required bypass surgery and she continues to have poor blood flow to her extremities. This problem, coupled with her osteoarthritis, causes pain in her lower extremities with ambulation. She is, therefore, extremely limited in her mobility, able to walk only short distances. She is also dependent in many of her ADLs including dressing and bathing. Due to the above disabilities, the patient has been living in a nursing home for the last two years and is significantly dependent on her caregivers. The patient speaks Spanish only and due to her dependency and need for full time care in a skilled nursing facility, she is unable to attend classes in English or U.S. history and civics that would be required to take a citizenship exam.
