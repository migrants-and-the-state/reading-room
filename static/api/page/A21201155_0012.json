  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 9/21/2023 I hereby declare, on oath, that solutely and entirely renounce and abjure al legiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will per- form noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God. If you cannot promise to bear arms or perform noncombatant service because of religious training and belief, you may omit those promises when taking the oath. \"Religious training and belief\" means a person's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code. 6. THIS BLOCK APPLIES ONLY TO APPLICANTS WHO HAVE FOREIGN-BORN CHILDREN WHO ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE. Some or all of your own foreign-born children (Not Step-Children) who are not yet citizens may possibly become United States citizens automatically when you are naturalized. This will happen: (1) If the child is a lawful permanent resident of the United States and still under 18 years of age when you are naturalized, and (2) The child's other parent is already a citizen or becomes a citizen before or at the same time that you become naturalized. If, however, the child's other parent is deceased, or if you are divorced and have custody of the child, then it makes no difference that the child's other parent was or is an alien. (3) If your child is illegitimate and you are the mother, only (1) above applies. (4) If the child is adopted, and was adopted before its 16th birthday and is in your custody. If you wish, you can apply for a Certificate of Citizenship for any of these children, which will show that they are United States citizens. If you do not want such a Certificate, write \"DO NOT\" in Question (36), page 3; if you do want such a Certificate, write \"DO\" in Question (36), page 3, and send the following with this application.

If you mail your application, attach a money order or check, payable to Immigration and Naturalization Service (Exceptions: If you reside in the Virgin Islands, remittance must be payable to Commissioner of Finance, Virgin Islands; and if in Guam, to Treasurer, Guam). Personal checks are accepted subject to collectibility. An uncollectible check will render the application and any documents issued pursuant thereto invalid. A charge of $5.00 will be imposed if a check in payment of a fee is not honored by the bank on which it is drawn. The fee will be refunded if for any reason the child does not qualify for the certificate. (2) Personal Description Form.-A completed Form N-604 for each child.
