Service New Post Office Building Chicago 7, Ill. 4/1 A 6 923 178 179 278 FOIA (b) (6) Dear Sir: Since we have not received any new appointment FE after sending back your letters ten days ago, we are just waiting. One of our witnesses, Miss Helen Pence, told us a while ago that Lewistown could be a closer place for us to go than Peoria. If nothing has been decided, we would like to request for Lewistown. Our summer schedules are heavier than regular quarters. It would be much easier for us to go to Lewistown during some weekend, say Friday afternoon, than to go to Peoria. But we should like to seek your convenience. If you have already arranged to have it in Peoria, please disregard this request. Many thanks for your attention. Very sincerely yours, Render Tuan Mei-ling Tuan earn Douglas Tuan john Ben Tuan"
