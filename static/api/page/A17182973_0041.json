Morally speaking, a Chinese will not do things like that since the----since they helped me that way I would continue to work for them. Q.

My children have been grown up and I have nothing to do at home, I mean in Brazil, so I spend the time as long as I can here. Q. During that period, How were you being supported in the United States?
