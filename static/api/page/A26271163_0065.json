  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 6/1/2023 Requested Information, Documents, and/or Forms Applicant: Margarita Sanchez Application for Naturalization, Form N-400 Alien Number: A026271163 Application ID: NBC*001474434 Please submit the following information, documents, or forms: The N400 Civics/History Re-Exam will be scheduled in approximately 60 days. Reason: Missing Evidence You did not provide the following documents which were requested by the Service: Birth Certificate: Please submit a copy of your birth certificate or other record of your birth. Evidence of Terminated Marriage(s): Please submit evidence of your terminated marriage in the form of a death certificate. Submitting Secondary Evidence and Affidavits The non-existence or other unavailability of required evidence creates a presumption of ineligibility. If a required document, such as a birth or marriage certificate, does not exist or cannot be obtained, an applicant or petitioner must demonstrate this and submit secondary evidence, such as church or school records, pertinent to the facts at issue. If secondary evidence also does not exist or cannot be obtained, the applicant or petitioner must demonstrate the unavailability of both the required document and relevant secondary evidence, and submit two or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by persons who are not parties to the petition who have direct personal knowledge of the event and circumstances. Secondary evidence must overcome the unavailability of primary evidence and affidavits must overcome the unavailability of both primary and secondary evidence. Where a record does not exist, the applicant or petitioner must submit an original written statement on government letterhead establishing this from the relevant government or other authority. The statement must indicate the reason the record does not exist, and indicate whether similar records for the time and place are available. However, a certification from an appropriate foreign government that a document does not exist is not required where the Department of State's Foreign Affairs Manual indicates this type of document generally does not exist. An applicant or petitioner who has not been able to acquire the necessary document or statement from the relevant foreign authority may submit evidence that repeated good faith attempts were made to obtain the required document or statement. However, where the Service finds that such document or statements are generally available, it may require that the applicant or petitioner submit the required document or statement."
