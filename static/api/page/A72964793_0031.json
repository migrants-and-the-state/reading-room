Ungar, of Counsel Teresa A. Bright San Francisco, CA 94133 Terry J. Helbush Michael K. Ungar Tel: (415) 421-0860 Kip Evan Steinberg Bill Ong Hing, of Counsel FAX: (415) ) 421-0772 June 3, 1993 Immigration & Naturalization Service 630 Sansome Street San Francisco, CA 94111 Attn. Dave Still Re: Josefa Feliciano Ramirez-Garcia aka Josefa Feliciana Ramirez-Guadamuz A28 961 620 Dear Dave: I wrote to you some months ago about this case and tried to contact you by telephone. I was some remiss in following up, so I am enclosing a copy of my previous letter and will be calling you again to see if we can resolve this lady's problem. Ms. Ramirez was granted permanent resident status on October 25, 1989 and is yet to receive her alien registration card because of the Immigration Service's mistake in issuing a green card to another person using Ms. Ramirez's number. Ms. Ramirez's granddaughter tells me that MediCal is again threatening to cut off her benefits because the INS will not verify her permanent resident status through the SAVE program. So, now it imperative that this matter be resolved. I enclose copies of my previous letter to you as well as previous correspondance from the INS. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Very truly yours, Jerry Terry J. Helbush TJH:bt"
