This fact was known to me just after passing a few years from my parents. c) The same year of birth has therefore been entered in my National Identity Card so as to make it proof of my birth for all purposes wherever I am required to submit this information. d) Since my birth I have shown the same year of birth and no change has been made. This is my real year of birth and I stand responsible for it at present and in future wherever I am asked about the year of my birth. Exact date is however not known to me due to passage of a long time of as many as 76 years, The above-mentioned statement given by me is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and nothing has been concealed therefrom.
