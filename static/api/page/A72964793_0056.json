The applicant is a single 81 year old female from Nicaragua. She entered the United States on September 9, 1983, as a visitor. From 1942 until December 22, 1972, she worked for Luis Zamoza. She lived in their mansion and was the nanny to his children. After his death, she worked for his widow. On December 22, 1972, an earthquake hit Nicaragua and the Zamoza family moved to New York City. She then started to live with her daughter. Just before the war, she said La Turbas were constantly following and trying to hit her. LaTurbas would go to her house and harass her. This continued until she left Nicaragua. She was also almost hit by a car. In June 1980, the fighting started in Nicaragua. She stated that there was gun fire and later on the planes came in and started to bomb the area. She claims that some of the artillery came thru her house. She stayed face down on the floor for three days without any food. She was forced to attend the CDS meetings. When she was leaving Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan Immigra- tion \"X\" out her United States visa. She had to pay $300 U. S. dollars to obtain an exit visa. She claims that if she returned to Nicaragua that she would be killed. The applicant's request for asylum is deemed to be of undetermined merit. Sincerely, David N. Ilchert District Director DIEXM:M.Fernandez: 04-25-88:sv Enclosures:"
