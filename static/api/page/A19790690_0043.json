She has been a great source of comfort to my wife who has been quite sick during this, her first, pregnancy. I would appreciate very much your consideration in this matter and hope that you will give her per- mission to extend her stay with us so that she will be able to continue caring for my wife in this difficult period. Thank you very much. Sincerely yours, James M.Geever James McGeever P.S. I am enclosing a check for $10.00 for the fee and her form I-94"
