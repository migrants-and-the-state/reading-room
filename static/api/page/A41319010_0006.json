I am a licensed physician and a staff member at Laguna Honda Hospital. I have reviewed this patient's medical history and records and have conducted a physical examination of Mr. Julio Garcia on November 22, 1996. Mr. Julio Garcia's diagnoses include: 1. Congestive Heart Failure 2. Coronary Artery Disease 3. Relative Dysphagia, urinary Incontinence I understand that Congress allows for a general waiver of all testing requirements for persons of any age who could not reasonably be expected to pass a citizenship test because of a permanent physical disability. It is my opinion that he will not be able to adequately participate or comply with an oral or written examination due to his physical impairments and should be eligible for a disability waiver of the English language and knowledge of United States history and government requirement. Sincerely, Vicky Young, M.D. Nicky young (415) 664-1580 375 Laguna Honda Blvd. San Francisco, CA 94116"
