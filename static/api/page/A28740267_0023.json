Ilchert, District Director Immigration and Naturalization Service 630 Sansome Street San Francisco, California 94111 Dear Mr. Ilchert: In response to your letter asking for an advisory opinion on the above applicant's request for asylum in the United States, we are of the opinion that the allegations made by the applicant do not constitute a well-founded fear of persecution upon return to Nicaragua within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. Specifically, the applicant did not substantiate or give details about the claim that he publicly manifested his anti-Sandinista opinions, nor did he show that he was persecuted for this alleged manifestation. This opinion is based on our analysis of country conditions and other relevant factors, plus an evaluation of the specific information provided in the application. We do not have independent information about this applicant. The strength of the application may be affected by your interview or hearing, or additional information subsequently presented by the applicant. Should you believe that any such additional information warrants further consideration, we will be happy to review the file again Sincerely, Edward H. Wilkinson, Director Office of Asylum Affairs Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs"
