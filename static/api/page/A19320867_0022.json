Mrs. Wu showed definitive signs of difficulties in recent memories which could seriously interfere with her ability to acquire and retain new information. The condition has been slowly progressive and is deemed permanent in nature. In my opinion, she should be exempted from the language and citizenship examination as the acquiring of such new information would be exceedingly difficult for her and may present undue stress with deleterious consequence.
