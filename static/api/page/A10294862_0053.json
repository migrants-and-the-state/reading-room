FOIA (b)(6) Aug. 1, 1968 MEMORANDUM Visa petitions submitted by Doo MAR in behalf of his sons, Kin Sun MA and Chong Sun MA, and his wife, Lai-Yung Wong MAR. Service file A10-294-862 relating to the petitioner Doo MAR shows that he was admitted to the United States at New York, N.Y., on May 8, 1955 as a crowman. He was accorded the benefits of Section 24h(a)(1) of the Iram. & Nat. Act, as ameneded and on December 18, 1967 a record of entry for lawful permanent res- idence was granted. He is presently the holder of alien registration card (I-151) number A10-291-862. Doo MAR has now submitted visa petitions for his wife, Lai-Yung MAR and two sons, Kin Sun MA and Chong Sun MA. In support of these visa petitions he has submitted affidavits by himself and daughter, Bik Sim YKE, Jin Jong LEE and Yu Quon MAHR, together with group family photographs with the persons therein properly identified. Because birth certificates are not available, the petitioner Doo Mar and his married daughter Bik Sim YEE were bloodtyped at the Blood Grouping Laboratory in Boston on July 2, 1968 and the results were found to be compatible. Beneficiaries are residing at 1842 East 6th Ave., Vancouver, B.C., Canada and should be blood- typed. All of the evidence submitted together with the results of the bloodtpying of the petitioner and his daughter will be forwarded to the American Consul at Vancouver, B.C., Canada with the visa petitions. It is recommended that the visa petitions be approved on the condition that the bloodtyping of the petitioner and his daughter and the beneficiaries are found to be compatible. Invigrant Inspector"
