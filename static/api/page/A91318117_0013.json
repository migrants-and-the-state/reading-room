  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 7/13/2023 Attachment to Form I-692 Page Two A91 318 117 245a. 2 (k) (5) states in part: (5) Public assistance and criminal history verification. Declarations by an applicant that he or she has not been the receipt of public cash assistance and/or has not had a criminal record are subject to a verification of facts by the Service. The applicant must agree to fully cooperate in the verification process. Failure to assist the Service in verifying information necessary for the adjudication of the application may result in a denial of the application. Since a completed medical report, Form I-193 did not accompany your petition, you were requested by letter dated March 20, 1989 to submit one. By letter dated June 30, 1989 this Service attempted to notify you of this Service's intent to deny your application, however, this notice was returned by the Postal Service as having been unclaimed by you. A completed medical report has not been submitted to accompany your application. The record establishes that you have failed to assist this Service in the verification of information necessary for adjudication of your application. It must be concluded therefore that you have failed to establish eligibility for the benefit sought. Accordingly your application is denied."
