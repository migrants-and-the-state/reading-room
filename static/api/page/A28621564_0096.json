  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 7/28/2023 Name: Roman Avellan, Jose Antonio File: A28 621 564 Page: 2 (e) What, when, and where was your first assignment? Ever since the Health Department was militarized my assignments were related to the public health and environmental fields. As part of my assignment I had to travel throughout the country. I had to supervise laboratories we had in the different departments - Rivas, Matagalpa, Carazo, the Atlantic Coast. Personnel from the World Health Organization came to supervise as to the progress of our studies - Later the Inter-American Cooperative Service developed into planning and control regarding water and milk, nutrition, maternity guidance, childhood diseases, etc. (f) Did you receive any other training? If so, what, where and when? Other training I received was on Food Analysis, Water Potability. I had to travel throughout the country taking samples to later analyze for bacteriological factors to determine if the waters were drinkable or not, and how to treat water that was contaminated. I also analyzed milk products (milk, butter, cheese) to control human consumption availability; In 1946 I travelled to Ecuador, as a member of the Health Department of Nicaragua and together with the Red Cross of Nicaragua, we took food, clothes and medicines and engaged in a vaccination campaign after an earthquake had devastated a large region in Ecuador. We cooperated with the Ecuadorian Government of Doctor Galo Plaza together with a team of doctors and technicians I spent two weeks in the vaccination campaign and water analyses activities in Ecuador. 2. Provide details of all engagements in which you participated (date, place, type of weapon used; military or nonmilitary unit; unit designation; number of people involved in fighting; was the action offensive or defensive? My participation in the military was solely a member of the Medical Corps. I never engaged in military exercises, nor ever carried weapons. My services were related with clinical laboratory activities - water analyses, epidemiology, vaccination, serology food analyses, bacteriology, studying of samples, etc."
