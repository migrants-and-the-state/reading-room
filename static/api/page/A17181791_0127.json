IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE REPORT OF INVESTIGATION TITLE FILE NUMBER MAO, Pei-Ing A17 181 791 aka MAO, Betty REPORT MADE AT DATE BY D Sauct Los Angeles 7/8/69 Philip H. Smith, Investigator SYNOPSIS The SUBJECT is a 54-year old citizen of China who was admitted to the United States as an immigrant during January 1968 on the basis of a visa petition submitted on her behalf which reflected that she would be employed in the United States as a domestic worker. The SUBJECT's admission to the United States was sponsored by a resident of Corona Del Mar, California who petitioned for the SUBJECT's admission to the United States to work in her home as a domestic worker. When investigation was conducted into the bona fides of the employment offer submitted on the SUBJECT's behalf, it was ascertained that the person who submitted the petition on the SUBJECT's behalf, filled the SUBJECT's position prior to the SUBJECT's arrival in the United States. The petitioner reported that she informed the employment agency that the position had been filled and the employment agency then advised her that the SUBJECT could be placed in another home. The petitioning employer reports that the SUBJECT has never worked for her. The SUBJECT executed a sworn statement in which she reported that when she obtained her immigrant visa, she believed that she would work for the petitioning employer in the United States. She states that subsequent to the issuance of her immigrant visa, but prior to her arrival in the United States, she was informed by the employment agency that her position with the petitioning employer had been filled, and that she would be placed in another home. The SUBJECT has worked for two different families as a domestic worker since she arrived in the United States. She states that she has never been employed by the person who submitted the petition on her behalf. Her present employer states that she is willing to sponsor the SUBJECT's entry to the United States as an immi- grant. An application has been submitted for the institution of deportation proceed- ings because the position that the SUBJECT was to fill in the United States, was not in existence at the time of the SUBJECT's admission to the United States as an immigrant.
