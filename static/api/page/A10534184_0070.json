DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Immigration and Naturalization Service (Rev. 4-6-56) IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE RECORD OF SWORN STATEMENT IN AFFIDAVIT FORM AFFIDAVIT IN RE: DE LA HOYA-Sanchez, Vicente FILE No. A10 534 184 EXECUTED AT Los Angeles, California DATE August 27. 1956 Before the following officer of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service: Byron A. Stein, Investigator, Acting Spanish interpreter I, VICENTE DE LA HOYA-Sanchez acknowledge that the above-named officer has indenti- fied himself to me as an officer of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service authorized by law to administer oaths and take testimony in connection with the enforcement of the Immigration and Nationality laws of the United States. I desire to make a sworn statement before him in the above- named case. I understand that any statement which I make must be freely and voluntarily given and that it may be used by the Government as evidence in any proceedings against me or any other person. Being duly sworn, I make the following statement freely and voluntarily: My forrect name is VICENTE DE LA IOYA-Sanchez. I am a citizen and subject of Mexico. I immigrated to the United States at El Paso, Texas on August 18, 1955 and I have shown you my passport. (Reference is to Form I-151) Before August 18, 1955 I had been in the United States under contract three times, the first time at Harlingen, Texas, the other two times at El Centro, California. I returned to Mexico each time when my contract was terminated. I departed from the United States at the end of my last contract November 18, 1952 at Calexico, California. I remained in Mexico, working in Cd. Juarez and going to visit my family in Villa Ignacio Ramirez, Dgo., Mexico until I immigrated in 1955. In about June, 1955 I went to the American Consulate in Cd. Juarez to find out what documents were necessary to immigrate to the United States and to get the application. I was told to get a copy of my birth certificate, a Mexican passport, Police letters of good conduct from Cd. Juarez and Villa Ignacio Ramirez, an X-ray and an employment letter from the United States. I myself secured all but the last letter listed and filled out my application. I then went to the office of CEFERINO ANCHANDO because his office was near the Consulate in Cd. Juarez for the purpose of having him write to my former employer in California for an employment letter. I went to him because I could not write in English. He told me that he could arrange employment for me in El Paso and because that was closer to my family in Mexico, I accepted. I paid him 400 Pesos, 200 when I first went to him and about a month later 200 when I received the letter. I did not know the man who signed the letter. I took all of the documents to the Consul, paid for the visa and entered the United States. I returned then to the office of Ceferino Anchondo to learn the address of my employer and he told me that there would be no work until September and that picking cotton. I returned to the United States and looked for work near E1 Paso and could not find any and then I went to Bakersfield, California where I found work in the country. Since then I have worked in various places in California, Nevada and New Mexico. I now work as a mechanic for the L. A. MOTORS, 1011 E. 7th Street, Los Angeles, California. I have worked thete about two months. I now live at 639 Stanford St. Los Angeles. I have lived there since I came to Los Angeles June 4, 1956. I do not remember the name of the employer who signed the detter in my visa and I never met him. I did not know that the letter given me by Ceferino Anchando was fraudulent.
