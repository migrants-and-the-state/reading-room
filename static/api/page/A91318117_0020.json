(B) Exact period of employment. (C) Periods of layoff. (D) Duties with the company. (E) Whether or not the information was taken from official company records; and (F) Where records are located and whether the Service may have access to the records. If the records are unavailable, an affidavit form letter stating that the alien's employment records are unavailable and why such records are unavailable may be accepted in lieu of 245a.2 (d) (3) (i) (E) & (F) of this paragraph. This affidavit form letter shall be signed, attested to by the employer under penalty of perjury, and shall state the employer's willingness to come forward and give testimony if requested. In the event that the preferred historical documentation listed above cannot be submitted, the Service may accept affidavits as evidence to establish eligibility. However, the applicant must also submit a sworn explanation as to why such historical documentation cannot be obtained. Affidavits attesting you your identity, residence, financial responsibility or physical presence must conform to the specifications on the preceding page. This form is intended as a guideline and is not all-inclusive. Other evidence may be considered if none of the documents listed are available. Please do not use any false documents to attempt to prove your eligibility. Anyone caught using false materials may not qualify for legal status and may be prosecuted and/or deported from the United States."
