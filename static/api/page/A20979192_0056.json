The holder may rein- state this Certificate, in the event of default, at any time within the period of such suspension, by resuming payments hereon. Before this Certificate can be reinstated the holder hereof must forward it to the Secretary of the Association at Salt Lake City, who will reissue it as of a series as many months later than its present series, as the Certificate has been in default, and the maturity of this Certificate will thereby be extended for a period equal to the total time that default continued.
