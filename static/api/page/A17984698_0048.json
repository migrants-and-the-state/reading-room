A I came to Los Angeles, passing by E1 Centro but I cannot be sure whether I had dropped in to see Mr. Loo at that time. Q I don't think you are answering the question. (Stenographer asked to read the previous question to Mr. Wong.) (complies) A I don't think that particular period from April to June, I had visited the restaurant. Q Did you talk with Mr. Loo at the time you visited that restaurant? A He only say hello to me and we didn't enter into any conversation. Q Did he call you by name at that time? A That I cannot remember. Q To refresh your memory, I will ask the interpreter to read a statement you made on November 21st of last year and ask if that statement you made is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? (Read to Mr. Wong by Interpreter) A That was a true statement I made. Q I particularly question the first paragraph of that statement in which you stated \"I entered the United States at Calexico, California, on April 2, 1968. Following my entry into the United States I stayed over- night at 452 Main Street, E1 Centro, California, and then came directly to Los Angeles. My address has been 855 Cleveland Street, Room 21, Los Angeles, California, since my entry\". Is that the truth? A Yes. Q Where are the sleeping accommodations at the address, 452 Main Street, El Centro? A I didn't sleep there. Q Where did you sleep? A I didn't sleep. Q Is the cafe open all night? A The restaurant is open until 11 in the evening, I remember, I think I took an early transportation to Los Angeles. Q During that overnight or night visit to 452 Main Street, did you visit with Mr. Loo? A Very short visit. Q What would you consider a short visit, half an hour, one hour, 15 minutes, five hours. You said you stayed overnight. Now you say a short visit. How long is a short visit to you? A Approximately 15 minutes, he was busy in his work. - 7 -"
