Somoza's \"navy\" consisted of a handful of old patrol boats. The Sandinistas set out to acquire a fleet of more modern vessels. In 1983, they acquired two French Vedette patrol boats and two Soviet ZHUK patrol boats. In 1983-84, North Korea supplied two KIMJIN and two SINHUNG patrol boats. In 1984, Cuba delivered a third ZHUK and two YEVGENYA inshore minesweepers. In November 1984, the Soviet merchant ship Bakuriani delivered four Polish-built K-8 minesweeping boats.
