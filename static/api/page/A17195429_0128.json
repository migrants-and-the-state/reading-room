Airlines Limited Paschall International Corporation Mr. Paschall owns his own hom in Pasadena, is a person of very considerable means and whose annual income is substantially in excess of $15,000-$20,000 a year. I am intimately acquainted with Mr. and Mrs. Pas- chall's financial condition, but because of the attorney- client relationship which exists between Mr. and Mrs. Pas- chall and our law firm, I do not feel it is proper for me to go into further detail. Suffice it to say that Mr. and Mrs. Paschall's net worth is much more than sufficient to take care of any obligations they might have to any Chinese couple whom they may employ through the offices of the May- flower Placement Agency or otherwise. The Paschall family consists, in addition to Mr. and Mrs. Paschall, of three boys, one married and an official of FOIA (b) (6) the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City, and FOIA (b)(6) I can assure you that any agreement that Mr. and Mrs. Paschall may enter into with respect to the employment"
