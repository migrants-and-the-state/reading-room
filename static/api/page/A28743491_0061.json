Roger, District Director April 1, 1998 Ref: Notice of Intent to dismiss A# 28 743 491 I am writing to you regarding my above mentioned application and notice of intent to dismiss. I would like to bring to your notice that I was not able to attend an oath ceremony because of my physical inability As you must be aware of my age, which is more than a century already, it is kind of hard for me to sit for hours on a chair and wait for my turn. I am pretty sure that an oath ceremony certainly takes more than just a few hours. If you realize my situation, I am sure you would help me out somehow. I would try my best to appear for an oath ceremony on any given date in the near future. I thank you for your understanding and co-operation. Your early action regarding the above said would be highly appreciated. Jasoni Sincerely, sings JASWANT SINGH 1206 Fox Glove Ct. Glendora, Ca 91741 Encl. Two identical 2X2 inch photos, as required. Notice of intent to dismiss."
