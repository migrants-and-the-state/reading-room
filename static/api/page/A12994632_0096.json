District Director, United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, San Francisco, California. Dear Sir: CHU Wai Man, a current applicant for parole has provided in- formation concerning his American citizen father which is at variance with information provided by his sister, the petitioner. The petitioner, Katherine CHU WONG of 3030 Ross Road, Palo Alto, California, stated in 1947 at the time of her initial entry that her father was CHU Nup Woon, deceased. At the time of filing her petition on September 5, 1962, she stated that her blood father was GEE (CHU) Lap Lin whom she had never seen as he died before her birth. She claimed that her stepfather was Shu Wai (wy) JEE (CHU), who died in 1959 in Hong Kong. When reminded of her previous claim regarding her father, she stated that the correct spelling of his name should be GEE Lap Lin. CHU Wai Man informed us that his mother and father were married only once, to each other, and that the three names which his sister had given for the father and step-father all belong to the same per- son, his blood father, who returned from the United States and died in Hong Kong in 1959. CHU Wai Man stated that his grandfather took his father to the United States, probably as the son of a merchant. He reported that the name Nup Woon was used rarely, that Lap Lin was his father's marriage name, and that Shu Wai was his given name. The testimony of CHU Wai Man is believed correct, and his identity and relation to his sister have been conceded. The peti- tioner was naturalized in her own right, and her status in the United States would not be affected by the revelation that her father entered the United States in a false identity, which appears likely. Therefore, CHU Wai Man is being approved for parole. This matter is brought to your attention for whatever action may be appropriate with respect to the immigration record of Shu Wai (wy) JEE. Very truly yours, From: For the Consul S.Fammath General Frederick E. Farnsworth Consul jelly and"
