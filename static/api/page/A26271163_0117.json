It contains information that may be exempt from public release under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). This document is to be controlled, handled, transmitted, distributed, and disposed of in accordance with DHS policy relating to Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) information and is not to be released to the public or other personnel who do not have a valid \"need-to-know\" without prior approval from the originator.\" From: NRC, Field-Processes Sent: Friday, August 02, 2013 10:54 AM To: Robertson, Paula M Subject: RE: Axx XXX 163 I have the file in my possession. I have talked to the analyst over retirements and we will send the file attention to you. Once finished with the file please send it back to the NRC attention Josh Dorman. When the file is returned a decision will be made if the file will be sent back to NARA or if CIS will be updated to where it is no longer in NARA ownership. Thank you, Joshua Dorman Program Assistant (Contract Performance) Department of Homeland Security USCIS/NRC, Lee's Summit, MO FOIA (b)(6) From: Robertson, Paula M Sent: Thursday, August 01, 2013 2:32 PM To: NRC, Field-Processes Subject: RE: Axx XXX 163 The file shows quite a bit of movement at the NRC AFTER CIS shows FTC date of 3/4/2011, so that is why we thought maybe the file is actually at the NRC. It also shows a recent audit. Forgive my ignorance of your processes, but can you please take a look at this and confirm that AD1534 is allocated to NARA?
