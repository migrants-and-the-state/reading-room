Since 1947 he has been a graduate student and faculty member of the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Minnesota. During the years since 1947 I have acted as his advisor in his graduate studies and have been in close contact with him during all of this time. As a result of my close association with Mr. Liu, I am pre- pared to state my firm opinion and belief that (a) his moral character and standards are of the highest, (b) his philosophy of life and ideals are those held by the people of the United States, and (c) he does not belong to any organization or group whose aims are inimical to the welfare of the United States. Sincerely yours, Loyat Groundy Loyst C. Caverley LCC:hp State of Minnesota County of Hennepin Subscribed and sworn to before me a notary public this 20th day of June 1955. 9 ladys i.m.
