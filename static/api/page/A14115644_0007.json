I entered the United States on the 29th of December, 1919 through El Paso, Texas with my parents and brothers. (Means of entry: Walk Through). I was born 01-11-07 in Chipuagua, Mexico. We have sent correspondence to the regional offices in El Paso and Los Angeles, and always they reply that they have no record of me. We know well that that office keeps the records of past years, and in this way we can obtain some information from you. We are enclosing a money order of $5.00 in case of finding some document to send me.
