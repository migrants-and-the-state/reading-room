Department of Justice Immigration & Naturalization Service 300 North Los Angeles Street Los Angeles, California 90012 RE: MEYER, Esther 0 Our No. 124401 Gentlemen: This is to verify that the above-named patient is under our medical care at the present time. She was first seen here on July 13, 1966, and has been under my care since that date. P This patient has a chronic cardiac condition, which definitely pre- vents her from traveling. There has been no improvement in her con- dition, and some decompensation continues. She is quite elderly, being 82 years of age, and since we at the Clinic provide her medical care, and her son, Joseph Meyer, provides for her other needs, we respectfully request that she be allowed to remain in the United States. Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to call upon us. Sincerely yours, Jack Heinrich, M.D. Cedars of Lebanon Division i 6-3-69 RW to 6/5/70 James LOS/DE Eventho Dumerical non- Prefis and open Subject too physically ill to ludge CEDARS OF LEBANON HOSPITAL heylter wefer a Warren fa N-P Physical Exam & reterve cashe is unable prantylate Jayrie well.
