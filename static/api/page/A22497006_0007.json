Penalties. Both the applicant and the licensed medical doctor or licensed clinical psychologist are required to complete and sign the form under penalty of perjury. All statements contained in response to questions in this certification are declared to be true and correct under penalty of perjury. Title 18, United States Code, Section 1546, provides in part: Whoever knowingly makes under oath, or as permitted under penalty of perjury under Section 1746 of Title 28, United States Code, knowingly subscribes as true, any false statement with respect to a material fact in any application, affidavit, or other document required by the immigration laws or regulations prescribed thereunder, or knowingly presents any such application, affidavit, or other document containing any such false statement - shall be fined in accordance with this title or imprisoned not more than ten years or both. If either the applicant or the licensed medical doctor or licensed clinical psychologist includes in this certification form any material information that the party knows to be false, the applicant and/or licensed medical doctor or licensed clinical psychologist may be liable for criminal prosecution under the laws of the United States. The knowing placement of false information on the application may subject the applicant and the licensed medical doctor or psychologist to criminal penalties under Title 18 of the United States Code and to civil penalties under Section 274C of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1324c. Privacy Act Notice: Authority for the collection of the information requested on this form is contained in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(15), 1183A, 1184(a), and 1258. The information will be used principally by the Service to whom it may be furnished to support an individual's application for naturalization under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Submission of the information is voluntary. It may also, as a matter of routine use, be disclosed to other federal, state, local and foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies. Failure to provide the necessary information may result in the denial of the applicant's request for an exception to the English language and U.S. history and civics requirement in the applicant's naturalization application. Reporting Burden: A person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. We try to create forms and instructions that are accurate, can be easily understood, and which impose the least possible burden on you to provide us with information. Often this is difficult because some immigration laws are very complex. Accordingly, the reporting burden for this collection of information is computed as follows: 1) learning about the form, 30 minutes; 2) completing the form, 60 minutes; and 3) assembling and filing the application, 30 minutes, for an estimated average of 120 minutes per response. If you have comments regarding the accuracy of this estimate, or suggestions for making this form simpler, you can write to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street, N.W., Room 5307, Washington, D.C. 20536. Do not mail your completed application to this address. Form N-648 (06/24/97) Page 2"
