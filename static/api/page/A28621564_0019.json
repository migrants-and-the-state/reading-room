  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 7/28/2023 Please Note Training information relative to the procedures for properly recording fingerprints can be obtained from your nearest FBI Field Office or the Criminal Justice Information Services Division at FBI Headquarters, in Washington, D.C. Because of the vastness of our fingerprint records, it is imperative that a complete and accurate classification formula be determined for searching and filing in each instance. Accurate classifying depends upon the best possible rolled impressions that can be taken. Fully rolled, clearly recorded impressions allow for accurate pattern interpretation, ridge counting, and whorl tracing. It is suggested that each newly recorded fingerprint card be examined to ascertain if it can be fully classified, bearing in mind the following: 1 LOOP 2. WHORL 3. ARCH CENTER DELTAS OF LOOP DELTA THE LINES BETWEEN CENTER OF THESE LINES RUNNING BETWEEN LOOP AND DELTA MUST SHOW DELTAS MUST BE CLEAR ARCHES HAVE NO DELTAS While every effort is made to accurately classify, search and when appropriate retain every fingerprint card submitted, in some instances this is not possible. The FBI fully recognizes the occurrences of situations which challenge the ingenuity of the identification officer to secure classifiable impressions. Your earnest cooperation is solicited in obtaining the best possible impressions in each block on each fingerprint card. By doing so, you are rendering a vital service and making a major contribution to all agencies participating in the fingerprint exchange program. *U.S.GPO:1997-426-227"
