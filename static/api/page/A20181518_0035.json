  "full_text": "The witness testified that he was born in Russia about 1891. He had a sister, Esther, who was \"much older!! than he. He remembers that when he was 9 or 10 years old, Esther married a man named \"Young,\" but he can't remember Young's first name. He recalls the occasion well, however, as he was a child and had to stay home while other members of the family went to the wedding. About a year after the wedding, a child was born to Esther and her husband. The child was named Joseph. (This would be the applicant). The witness remembers this well, as he was living in the same town when Joseph was born. The witness testified further that applicant and his parents immigrated to the U.S. while applicant was still a very small child. The witness came to the U.S. about 1910 and saw applicant and# his parents occasionally thereafter. Gen. Atty. (Nationality) EXHIBIT 9 toloming uncle Eubibit Identification Form G146.2 GPO 943-662"
