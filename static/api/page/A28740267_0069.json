A copy of their opinion is enclosed for your information. The Bureau has concluded that you have failed to establish that you have a well-founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the United Nations Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. The evidence of record is insufficient to establish that you have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of your race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Consequently, you do not qualify as a \"refugee\" as defined in Section 101 (a) (42) (A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. Therefore, this Service intends to deny your request for asylum in the United States. You are hereby given the opportunity to inspect, explain and rebut the opinion offered this Service by the Bureau. In addition, you are hereby granted a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice to offer evidence in support of your request for asylum and in opposition to the grounds stated for denial. Address your reply, if any, to the above address with a copy of this notice. If no additional evidence is submitted within the stated period, your request for asylum will be adjudicated on the evidence previously submitted. The record portion of your file is available for your review and inspection in the office of the Examinations Branch, Room 205, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 630 Sansome Street, San Francisco, California, 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, Monday through Friday, except holidays. If you appear in this office to review your file, you will be asked to present this letter. Sincerely, David n. llchert David N. Ilchert mz District Director Enclosure: DIEXM: T. RICE 07/20/88 hm I"
