After consultation with the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs of the Department of State, and careful consideration of the information you submitted, it has been determined that you have failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution upon return to Nicaragua. A copy of the advisory opinion received from the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs of the U.S. Department of State is enclosed for your review. You have fifteen (15) days in which to submit additional evidence in support of your application for asylum before a final decision is made. Please submit such evidence, in person, to this office at Room 334 on or before December 28, 1987. It must be accepted and date stamped by an Immigration Employee. Upon denial of your application, any employment authorization or extension previously granted in connection with your application for asylum will be terminated. Please make reference to the A-file number listed in all future contacts with this Service. Sincerely, James W. Pomeroy District Director BW/bb cc:File IXC D."
