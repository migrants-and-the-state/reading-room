  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 9/13/2023 751 KATHERINE LANE ARCADIA, CA 91006 ADDENDUM NEIGHBORHOOD COMMENTS The subject is located one block North West of the intersection of the Foothill (210) Freeway and Baldwin Avenue. The neighborhood is made up of good quality one and two story single family residences of various ages and designs. Good general maintenance prevails. Most homes within the subject's market area were built during the 1950s. However, new construction continues as older homes are razed. Older homes have been modernized and compete well with the newer ones. The Los Angeles Arboretum is three blocks South, Santa Anita Race Track is four blocks South East and shopping, schools and other support facilities are nearby. SALES COMPARISON COMMENTS Only one recent sale could be found within the subject's market area of a similar age. Location adjustment made for traffic noise. Comparable one is located slightly closer to the Foothill Freeway. It backs to a residential site and is exposed to less traffic noise than the subject. Comparables two and three are located on quiet interior streets and also back to residential sites.
