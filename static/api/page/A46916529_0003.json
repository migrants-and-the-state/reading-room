Therefore, your application must be, and, hereby is, denied. In accordance with Title 8, Code of Federal Regulation, 274a.12 (c) (9) your authorization to accept employment was limited to the time necessary to decide the case. Inasmuch as the application for adjustment has been denied, authorization to accept employment is terminated, pursuant to Title 8, Code of Federal Regulation, 274a.14 (a) (1) . You will be further advised of procedures to effect your departure from the United States. Attachment to Form I-291 In Re: Francisca Hortencia Toledo File: A70 023 120"
