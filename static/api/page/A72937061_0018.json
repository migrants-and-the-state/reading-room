CURRENT SCREEN 03/08/1996 10:28:55 USER ID: HUMBERTO FOREIGN AFFAIRS MANUAL - DOCUMENTS, PAKISTAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MILITARY RECORDS: Unavailable. BIRTH CERTIFICATES: Available. Reporting of births is voluntary, and records are not uniformly kept, particularly in rural areas. Almost all records of vital statistics of the Karachi Municipality were burned in 1948. Where a record of birth exists, a certificate to that effect may be obtained from the Registrar of Births and Deaths or the Director of Health Services in the municipality or, in rural areas, from the union council, district council or district health officer. Caution should be used, however, in accepting such certificates, since they frequently do not match the original ledgers. Births also may be registered late. In lieu of a birth certificate, Pakistanis often use school records attested by the headmaster or principal of the school or affidavits attested by Class I Officers in the government. DEATH CERTIFICATES: Available. Records of deaths are inconsistent, but, where the death is recorded, a certificate can be obtained from the Registrar"
