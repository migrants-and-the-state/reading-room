United States Government Naturalization Service Los Angeles California Dear Sirs, Regarding Bruno Palos of 290 Princeton Avenue, Claremont, I wish to say that I have known this family personally for the last seven years, having become acquainted with them through their daughter Corrine who was a member of Troop 17 Girl Scouts in Claremont California. There are also two sons in this family and all three children are attending the Claremont City Schools and making good records for themselves. During these seven years Bruno and Mary his wife have been permanentely employed. At first they owned a small house in the Arbol Verde Village Project for Mexican Americans. During the last two years they have bought a a fine new home at 290 Princeton Avenue, where they now live. This Catholic family work together as a group, are interested in their community, and have proven to be a stable and worth while family in Claremont.
