Consulate of Haiti Port of Prince, Haiti To Whom it May Concern: This is to confirm that Madelene Borno provides services to me and has been doing so for in excess of five (5) years. Among other things, she caters parties, including the preparation and serving of hors d'oeuvres and full course meals. She also has provided me with other services relating to the preparation of food off premises, the supervision of household services and the like. It is also my understanding that Ms. Borno operates a snack bar and provides catering services to others through the Montana Tennis Club. Ms. Borno has been a reliable and diligent person in my experience. I hope you will find her likewise. Sincerely, Cyrus E. Hornsby, III CEH:cat"
