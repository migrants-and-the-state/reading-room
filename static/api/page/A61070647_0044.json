If you have comments on the accuracy of this burden estimate and/or recommendations for reducing it, please send them to A/GIS/DIR, Room 2400 SA-22, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC 20522-2202 CONFIDENTIALITY STATEMENT AUTHORITIES: The information asked for on this form is requested pursuant to Section 212(a) and 221(d) and as required by Section 222 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Section 222(f) provides that the records of the Department of States and of diplomatic and consular offices of the United States pertaining to the issuance and refusal of visas or permits to enter the United States shall be considered confidential and shall be used only for the formulation, amendment, administration, or enforcement of the immigration, nationality, and other laws of the United States. Certified copies of such records may be made available to a court provided the court certifies that the information contained in such records is needed in a case pending before the court. PURPOSE: The U.S. Department of State uses the facts you provide on this form primarily to determine your classification and eligibility for a U.S. immigrant visa. Individuals who fail to submit this form or who do not provide all the requested information may be denied a U.S. immigrant visa. Although furnishing this information is voluntary, failure to provide this information may delay or prevent the processing of your case.
