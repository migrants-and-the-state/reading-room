I have come here for medical treatment and having trave- lled so long and having already spent a large sum of money, I am not about to go back without full treatment. I am suffering from a severe hearing loss and Dr. Fraser has asked me to stay until he is satisfied that I am cured. Please extend my visa until August 31st 1975. Very truly yours, ch. Bhagat. encl:entire package C. G. Bhagat INDEX CHECKED 6/23/7 on TN"
