His work consisted of maintaining a 3 acre grove for me. He also, worked for other parties in this area at the same time. Mr. Mangana worked for several people that I knew for some years before and after he contracted with me. His work was satisfactory; but, I no longer could afford to maintain the grove the way that I wanted. Therefore, to the best of my knowledge, he has been in this country continuously since the early 1970's and has worked for many different parties.
