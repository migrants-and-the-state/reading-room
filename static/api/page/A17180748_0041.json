I regretfully gave him notice of termination due to my returning to the U. S. A. in the near future. I found Lo Yung Sing ar excellent cook in the properation of both European and Chinese dishes. He ia sober, honest and his manners are beyond repreach. I have no hesitation in recommending his to any one who requires his services in hia trade. C.de Redial ( C.de Bedior ) 10"
