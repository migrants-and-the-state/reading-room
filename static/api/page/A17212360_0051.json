During this time I have found her to be very reliable, efficient, hardworking and trust-worthy. I had to dispense of her services, due to the fact, we are now living in Hong Kong. I would recommend this woman to anyone who desires a good cook general Amah. Yours faithfully, Betty Kendall Besty Ras all"
