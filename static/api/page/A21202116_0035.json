Each fingerprint card indicates by number or notation on the back of the fingerprint card the particular reason or reasons for its return. (1) Ink was unevenly distributed (8) One or more fingers printed twice (2) Fingers not fully inked or rolled (9) One or more impressions missing or partially missing (3) Too much ink Please indicate if there is an amputation. If no (4) Insufficient ink amputations, obtain these fingerprints. In cases of (5) Some impressions smudged, possibly fingers slipped bent or paralyzed fingers, it is suggested that a spoon while being rolled, or fingers not clean and dry or similar instrument be used and the fingers be (6) Ridge characteristics not distinct, possibly due to. the printed individually nature of the individual's employment or some other (10) Fingerprints not in sequence in spaces indicated cause. Legible prints may be obtained after a few days (11) Impressions not black on standard white fingerprint (7) Hands have been reversed card stock. Due to the volume of fingerprints contained in the fingerprint files of the FBI, and the use of super break-ups and extensions in conjunction with the Henry Classification System, it is necessary to obtain exact ridge counts and tracings of all ten fingers in order to search our files properly. In the event of serious injury to a finger precluding the taking of prints of the finger at this time, it is suggested that printing be done at a later date when a complete set of prints may be secured. It is suggested that reprints be obtained and forwarded to the FBI for appropriate attention. When submitting the reprints it is not necessary to return the original fingerprint card, as only one copy of each set of fingerprints is necessary for retention in this Bureau's files. For your information, a check by name only has been made on the enclosed prints with negative results. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
