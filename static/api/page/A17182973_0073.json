(cont'd.) time and the period of a resident in the same country as you are asking me/so important to my application. My point is to get a visa as a tourist and so long we got an immigrant visa application approved by this city, I mean Los Angeles as we understood that. Q. Now sir, the approved immigrant visa that you are referring to - let us make it a matter of record that that is the visa petition filed in your behalf by your wife and approved in Los Angeles. Is that correct? A. Well, according to my understand yes. We were informed by the Consulate and certainly we know that, why were we by this country, not by me and my lawyer and it approved that too, and I am sure Sir, you have the whole file. Q. Now sir, it is also a matter of record and evidence that you and your Atttorney just reviewed, that on February 8th, the date you had your interview with the American Consulate in Sao Paulo, you were told that your application for immigrant visa was denied. Is that correct? A. We were informed by the Consulate in Sao Paulo, yes and it was not denied and we even paid the visa fee and which I did not turn back yet. The Consulate was still with my fee for visitor, yet over there and the point is they asked me to get another affidavit of support as I told you. Q. Then the American Consulate did not tell you the application for an immigrant visa to the United States had been denied? A. No actually not to my understanding I don't seem I don't understand why my application should be denied. Q. Then the American Consulate did not, as you understand it, inform you that your application for an immigrant visa had been denied. But you understood, actually, that it would not be granted on the affidavit of support that he had, at that time, and he was to give you more time to obtain a more complete affidavit of support. Was that you under- standing, sir? A. What do you mean he you mean he as the Consulate? Q. Yes sir. A. Yes. Through my understanding it was that. The Vice Consul told me that the we have to get another affidavit and the second one issued by someone else was not in the I mean officially in the form. Q. Now you have, also, stated that the reason that you made the erroneous statement on your application for a visitor's visa with the American Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, was merely to expedite the visitor's visa because FOIA (b)(6) Is that correct? -6-"
