A That I cannot remember. Q Well, inasmuch as you were going to work for Mr. Loo certainly you must have told him when you would report for work, did you do that? A I told him that I am going to Los Angeles to handle some of my private affairs and as soon as that is finished I shall come back to work for him. Q Did Mr. Loo agree to that arrangement? A He agreed to that. BY ATTORNEY LEE TO RESPONDENT Q When was the last time you saw Mr. Loo? A The last time is December last year. Q And during that time did you tell Mr. Loo that your brother was ill and that you have to clear up your affairs in Calexico before you would commence your employment with him, did you inform him of that? A I told him my brother is sick now and I shall discuss with him about employment later on as soon as I am available. INVESTIGATOR GUIO: Q What was the approximate date of that conversation you had with Mr. Loo? A Some day in the morning in December prior to my brother's death. Q Would it be one week before his death, two weeks, three weeks, or a month before his death? A From the 10th to December 20th, during that period of time, bit I remember it was in the morning. Q That would be about the fourth time you had met Mr. Loo, between the tenth and 20th of December, is that right? A Yes, approximately that, but I cannot be sure how many times. Q An officer of this Service talked to Mr. Loo in December and he testified he had never met you. Can you explain that? A I can't explain that, I don't know. Q What is Mr. Loo's general appearance? A He is a man of medium size, little older than I am. Q Mr. Loo further stated that you have never visited in his Cafe at any time, how do you explain that? A I can describe the restaurant. - 8 -"
